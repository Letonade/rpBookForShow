## SPECIFICATION & FAQ FOR ITEMS

What about items listed in multiple sourcebooks?
If an item appears in multiple source books, it will be listed under the oldest hardcover it appears in, or the oldest softcover if it doesn't appear in a hardcover.

Why are some augmentations listed with multiple sources (e.g., CRB & AA)?
If an item is listed as having multiple sources, that means that both sources are required for that item to exist, not that the item appears in both sources. This happens when a class of items is defined as another class of items with a set of modifications.
