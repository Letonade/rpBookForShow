analog;This weapon does not use any advanced electronics, computer systems, or electrical power sources. It is immune to abilities that target technology. While this use of the word “analog” is not technically correct when referring to technology, use of the term in this way has become common.;badge badge-pill badge-secondary
magic;"While plenty of technology in Starfinder incorporates magical elements, some items operate solely through eldritch principles and thus follow different rules. This section covers magic items not addressed under another rules system (such as weapon fusions or augmentations). Magic items are often divided into held, worn, and consumable items. Held items (such as orbs and rods) must be held in a hand or similar appendage and activated manually like a weapon.

Worn magic items are things like rings, cloaks, amulets, and gloves. Just as your armor has a limited number of upgrade slots, you can only wear up to two magic items at once and have both function normally—beyond that, the magical fields start to interfere with each other. You can’t wear more than one of the same type of item (two cloaks, two hats, etc.) except for rings. If you put on an additional worn magic item beyond these first two, it does not function until you have no more than two total magic items worn. This limitation applies specifically to worn magic items, and does not apply to armor upgrades, held items, weapon fusions, augmentations, magic armor, consumables, or other forms of magic, all of which function normally.

Lastly, consumables are magic items like serums or spell ampoules that create an immediate and temporary effect when ingested.";badge badge-pill badge-info
technology;"Technology is everywhere in Starfinder, and includes any number of devices useful to adventurers, such as those presented on Table 7–26: Technological Items. Unless otherwise indicated, activating or deactivating an item is a standard action. Items that can be activated to modify an action you’re taking last for the duration of that action (such as those that modify skill checks), in which case activating the item is part of that action.

Unless otherwise specified, technological items use a battery and are subject to special abilities that work against items using batteries, charges, or technology. If an item doesn’t specify a usage, it needs very little power and has an internal battery designed to function for decades or even centuries without recharging. Items with a specified usage use a battery that comes fully charged when purchased. Such batteries can be recharged as normal using generators or recharging stations (see Professional Services on page 234), or they can be replaced (see Table 7–9: Ammunition for battery prices).";badge badge-pill badge-success
hybrid;"Hybrid equipment makes use of both technology and magic; though not necessarily in equal measure, both forces are crucial to the item’s function. Effects that modify or otherwise apply to magic or technological items also work when applied to hybrid items.";badge badge-pill badge-danger
