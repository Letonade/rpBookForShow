Name;description
Sonic;Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
Uncategorized;The following weapons are not considered to be a part of any other weapon category, and they follow the normal rules for weapons unless defined otherwise in their descriptions.
Solarian;Solarian weapon crystals are used by solarians to enhance their solar weapons. Complete rules for solarian weapon crystals appear in Weapon Types on page 170.
Shock;Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
Projectile;Projectile weapons fire solid rounds, such as bullets or rockets. While projectile weapons are relatively antiquated, they provide serviceable firepower at a reasonable price to many travelers and traders.
Plasma;"Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.
Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons."
Operative;Operative melee weapons are basic in design, but they are capable of dealing precise damage when wielded by a trained combatant. An operative can use the trick attack class feature with a weapon with the operative special property. Additionally, any character can add her Dexterity modifier rather than her Strength modifier to melee attack rolls with these weapons.
Laser;"Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.
Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas."
Grenades;Grenades are thrown weapons that detonate in an explosive radius when they reach the target. A grenade’s listing on Table 7–7: Grenades shows its explosion radius. Some grenades have additional effects, such as blinded or entangled, that apply only to creatures in the explosion radius that fail a Reflex save against the grenade. The DC of the save is equal to 10 + half the grenade’s item level + your Dexterity modifier. Any penalty you take to your attack roll also applies to this save DC.
Flame;"Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.
Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries."
Cryo;"Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.
One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons."
Disintegrator;"These powerful weapons are more formally referred to as high- energy proton decouplers, as they produce streams of energized fields that corrode and break down matter much in the way a subatomic acid would. However, since their effects appear to turn metal to slag, plastic to noxious vapor, and flesh to goo, they’re commonly known as disintegrators.
Most military units eschew disintegrators due to the weapons’ relatively short ranges and high energy consumption. Because they cause horrific pain, however, they are popular among bounty hunters, pirates, and other combatants who seek to intimidate as much as to kill. Devourer cultists in particular revere disintegrators because the weapons slough away their enemies’ flesh, as if some unseen force were consuming it. The most common disintegrator weapons follow a similar model sequence: liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator. A few types of disintegrator weapons employ alternate model sequences."
