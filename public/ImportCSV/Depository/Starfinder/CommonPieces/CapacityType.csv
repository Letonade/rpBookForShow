charge;Batteries charge powered weapons, but they can also be used to power an array of items, including powered armor and technological items. Batteries have a standardized size and weight, and items that take batteries all have a slot into which they fit, regardless of the item’s actual size. Weapons that use batteries list the highest-capacity battery they are capable of using as well as how many charges from the battery that each shot consumes.;charges;Battery 
flare;Usually made of magnesium, flares burn brightly and can deliver some heat. You can ignite a flare by hand without the need for a flare gun. A lit flare burns for 1 hour, and it can be wielded in melee combat as an improvised weapon that deals 1d2 fire damage.;flares;Flare
petrol;Petrol is a highly flammable blend of hydrocarbons that is used in flame weapons (and petrol is occasionally used by desperate adventurers as fuel or for other various utilitarian purposes). A petrol tank snaps easily into the housing of weapons that are specifically petrol-powered.;petrol;Petrol Tank 
round;Cased rounds are housed in magazines, which can be fitted into the appropriate weapon.;rounds;Rounds 
mini-rocket;These long, tapered shells hold combustible material as well as a chemical propellant.;mini-rockets;Mini-Rockets
dart;These light metal shafts each have a pointed tip and a reservoir to hold toxins or other appropriate substances that are typically liquid or viscous. While most combatants rely on darts to deliver toxins to enemies, particularly desperate or overworked field medics sometimes employ darts to conveniently deliver antitoxins, healing serums, and other beneficial drugs across a crowded battlefield. In these cases, medics often practice to improve their aim to ensure that this strategy is effective when employed.;darts;Darts
shell;These cartridges are packed with small metal spheres that scatter when the cartridge explodes.;shells;Scattergun Shells
nanite;Nanite canisters contain microscopic mechanical devices programmed to perform specific tasks. In weapons, they are typically tasked to dismantle as much of the target as they can before they are deactivated, but nanotechnology also has a wide range of peaceful uses.;nanites;Nanite Canisters
grenade;Grenades are thrown weapons that detonate in an explosive radius when they reach the target. A grenade’s listing on Table 7–7: Grenades shows its explosion radius. Some grenades have additional effects, such as blinded or entangled, that apply only to creatures in the explosion radius that fail a Reflex save against the grenade. The DC of the save is equal to 10 + half the grenade’s item level + your Dexterity modifier. Any penalty you take to your attack roll also applies to this save DC.;grenades;Grenade
missile;Missiles are heavy, snub-nosed munitions with devastating explosive power. A missile’s damage when fired from a missile launcher (such as an IMDS missile launcher) is listed in its entry in Table 7–9: Ammunition on page 179.;missiles;Missile 
drawn;When a weapon entry states that its capacity is drawn, it means that you can hold only one such weapon in the number of hands required to use it. You can hold only a single grenade or shuriken in one hand, you can have only one arrow nocked at a time, and you can wield only one net at a time. Drawing a weapon—such as grabbing a grenade from your belt—requires a move action. Drawing a weapon might be different than wielding it (see pages 243 and 247).;drawn;Inventory
arrow;Arrow shafts are made of carbon fiber–reinforced plastic and have metal or ceramic heads.;arrows;Arrows
