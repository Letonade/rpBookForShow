CR;192;ANARCHIC;2;-;The anarchic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a chaotic deity. Any attacks with the weapon are chaotic-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/chaotic and ignores the energy resistance of lawful dragons and lawful outsiders. The anarchic fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the axiomatic fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-anarchic;cr-fusion-anarchic
CR;192;ANCHORING;1;-;A weapon with the anchoring fusion has a chance to immobilize its targets. The weapon gains immobilization as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, choose each time whether to apply the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the immobilization effect. A target affected by the immobilization critical hit effect is unable to move from its space under its own power for 1d4 rounds. It cannot use any form of movement, including teleportation effects, to change its position. If the target is entirely contained in a mobile object (such as a starship or large vehicle), the target is immobile relative to its location within that object. Other creatures and forces can move the target normally.;magic;cr-fusion-anchoring;cr-fusion-anchoring
CR;192;AXIOMATIC;2;-;The axiomatic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a lawful deity. Any attacks with the weapon are lawful-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/lawful and ignores the energy resistance of chaotic dragons and chaotic outsiders. The axiomatic fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the anarchic fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-axiomatic;cr-fusion-axiomatic
CR;192;BANE;5;-;The bane fusion enhances the power of critical hits against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the bane weapon gains the stunned critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit against an appropriate foe, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the stunned effect. When you add this fusion to a weapon (or create it as a fusion seal), you must select a single creature type (aberration, animal, construct, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, outsider, plant, undead, or vermin) against which it will apply. If you select humanoid or outsider, you must also select one subtype. The stunned critical hit effect applies only against creatures of the selected type (and subtype, if selected). Once selected, the creature type and subtype can’t be changed.;magic;cr-fusion-bane;cr-fusion-bane
CR;192;BLASTING;2;-;The blasting fusion allows a weapon to make a single attack as a blast (see the blast weapon special property on page 180) once per day as a full action. This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon’s normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don’t have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the blasting fusion. Weapons that don’t require attack rolls to affect their targets also can’t benefit from the blasting fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-blasting;cr-fusion-blasting
CR;193;BLEEDING;5;-;The bleeding fusion weaves entropic energy into the weapon’s form. The weapon gains the bleed critical hit effect (see page 182). The amount of damage taken each round from this effect is equal to 1d6 per 5 levels of the weapon, rounded down. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the bleed effect. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can have this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-bleeding;cr-fusion-bleeding
CR;193;BURST;2;-;With the burst fusion, a weapon’s energy damage can form a small explosion that spills onto a second target. The weapon gains the arc critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the arc effect. The amount of damage dealt to the secondary target is equal to one-third the level of the weapon with the burst fusion (minimum 1). Only weapons that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage can benefit from a burst fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you select one of those types for the arc critical hit effect to apply to secondary targets when the fusion is added.;magic;cr-fusion-burst;cr-fusion-burst
CR;193;CALLED;1;-;A weapon with the called fusion can be teleported to its owner’s hand as a swift action, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A weapon with the called fusion must be in your possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function.;magic;cr-fusion-called;cr-fusion-called
CR;193;CORROSIVE;9;-;The corrosive fusion weaves the destructive power of acid into the weapon’s form. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with acid damage. You can activate or deactivate the corrosive fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with acid (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the corrosive fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal acid damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;magic;cr-fusion-corrosive;cr-fusion-corrosive
CR;193;DEAFENING;3;-;With the deafening fusion, a weapon releases a blast of low- frequency sonic energy on impact. The weapon gains the deafen critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the deafen effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage can benefit from a deafening fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-deafening;cr-fusion-deafening
CR;193;DEFIANT;1;-;A weapon with the defiant fusion resists efforts to be removed from its wielder. If you are wielding it when you are knocked unconscious, panicked, or stunned, it stays in your hand. You also gain a bonus to your KAC against combat maneuvers to disarm the weapon equal to one-fifth the weapon’s level (minimum +1).;magic;cr-fusion-defiant;cr-fusion-defiant
CR;193;DEVASTATING;5;-;You can apply the devastating fusion only to a weapon with two or more critical hit effects. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has the devastating fusion, you can select two of the critical hit effects to apply to the target (even if you are normally required to select just one critical hit effect).;magic;cr-fusion-devastating;cr-fusion-devastating
CR;193;DISPELLING;3;-;A weapon with the dispelling fusion gathers spare wisps of latent magic during combat, which it can then unleash in a focused effort to dispel magic. The weapon gains dispelling as a critical hit effect in combat. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, so you must be in combat and facing a significant enemy (see page 242) for it to gain this critical hit effect. If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access the critical hit effect, the GM decides. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted dispel magic, as the spell, using the weapon’s item level as the dispel check’s caster level.;magic;cr-fusion-dispelling;cr-fusion-dispelling
CR;193;DISRUPTIVE;3;-;The disruptive fusion imbues a weapon with powerful positive energy designed to disrupt the magical forces that allow undead to exist. The weapon ignores any DR and energy resistance of undead creatures. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-disruptive;cr-fusion-disruptive
CR;194;DURABLE;1;-;The durable fusion uses magical runes and reinforcements to significantly increase a weapon’s toughness. When determining a weapon’s hardness, Hit Points, and saving throws, treat its item level as being 5 higher. For more about calculating these values, see Breaking Objects on page 409.;magic;cr-fusion-durable;cr-fusion-durable
CR;194;ENTANGLING;2;-;A weapon with the entangling fusion gains the entangle weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an entangle attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is affected by the entangle condition. The entangle effect ends after 1d4 rounds if the target has not already escaped it. Only weapons that do bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or cold damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-entangling;cr-fusion-entangling
CR;194;FLAMING;5;-;The flaming fusion imbues a weapon with the fiery power of a star. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with fire damage. You can activate or deactivate the flaming fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with fire (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the flaming fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal fire damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;magic;cr-fusion-flaming;cr-fusion-flaming
CR;194;FROST;5;-;The frost fusion imbues a weapon with the icy cold of a dead world far from its system’s sun. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with cold damage. You can activate or deactivate the frost fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with cold (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the frost fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal cold damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;magic;cr-fusion-frost;cr-fusion-frost
CR;194;GHOST KILLER;5;-;Attacks from a weapon with this fusion deal full damage to incorporeal creatures. They also pass into the Ethereal Plane, allowing such attacks to affect ethereal creatures normally. Weapons with the ghost killer fusion can also score critical hits against incorporeal creatures. In addition, an incorporeal creature (though not an ethereal one) can pick up, move, or wield a ghost killer weapon.;magic;cr-fusion-ghost-killer;cr-fusion-ghost-killer
CR;194;GLAMERED;1;-;As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.;magic;cr-fusion-glamered;cr-fusion-glamered
CR;194;HOLY;2;-;A weapon with the holy fusion becomes blessed with divine energy from a good deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are good-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/good and ignores the energy resistance of evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead. The holy fusion cannot be added to weapons that have the unholy fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-holy;cr-fusion-holy
CR;194;HYBRIDIZED;1;-;A weapon with the hybridized fusion replaces much of its technological functions with magic counterparts. It gains the analog weapon special property (see page 180), and the core function of the weapon is considered to be a hybrid of magic and technology (rather than only the fusion counting as a hybrid item). A hybridized weapon still consumes ammunition and battery charges normally.;magic;cr-fusion-hybridized;cr-fusion-hybridized
CR;194;ILLUMINATING;1;-;The illuminating fusion causes a weapon to gain the bright weapon special property (see page 181). You can deactivate this fusion as a move action, in which case the weapon acts as if it does not have the bright property until it is reactivated (which also requires a move action).;magic;cr-fusion-illuminating;cr-fusion-illuminating
CR;194;KNOCKDOWN;6;-;With the knockdown fusion, a weapon disrupts a target’s center of gravity. The weapon gains the knockdown critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the knockdown effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-knockdown;cr-fusion-knockdown
CR;194;MERCIFUL;2;-;A weapon with the merciful fusion often hums pleasantly when at rest and makes soft, airy musical noises when it is used to make an attack. The magic of this fusion subdues the damaging effect of the weapon it is added to. While this fusion is active, the weapon’s regular damage becomes nonlethal damage. If the weapon deals two types of damage, both of the damage types become nonlethal. You can activate or deactivate the merciful fusion as a swift action.;magic;cr-fusion-merciful;cr-fusion-merciful
CR;194;OMINOUS;1;-;A weapon with the ominous fusion trails a shadowy haze behind it and moans a menacing dirge in battle. The weapon gains intimidation as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the intimidation effect. A target affected by the intimidation critical hit effect is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). A creature that gains the shaken condition from a weapon with the ominous fusion can’t gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.;magic;cr-fusion-ominous;cr-fusion-ominous
CR;195;RETURNING;1;-;You can add this fusion only to a weapon that has the thrown weapon special property. A returning weapon flies through the air back to you after you make a thrown ranged attack with it. It returns to you just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching the weapon when it comes back takes no action. If you can’t catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which you threw it.;magic;cr-fusion-returning;cr-fusion-returning
CR;195;SEEKING;3;-;The seeking fusion causes an attack from a weapon to veer toward its target. This negates any miss chance caused by the target having concealment, though it has no effect on miss chances from other sources (and does not offset the miss chance from a target having total concealment).;magic;cr-fusion-seeking;cr-fusion-seeking
CR;195;SHOCK;5;-;The shock fusion weaves the electrical energy of the universe into the weapon’s form. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with electricity damage. You can activate or deactivate the shock fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with electricity (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the shock fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal electricity damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.;magic;cr-fusion-shock;cr-fusion-shock
CR;195;SPELLTHROWER;2;-;"A weapon with the spellthrower fusion is able to have a single spell gem loaded into it at a time. It takes 1 minute to load a spell gem, and only gems containing a spell with a casting time of one standard action or less and a spell level no greater than one-quarter the weapon’s item level can be loaded into the weapon.
If you are proficient with and wielding the weapon, as a full action you can cast the spell contained within the spell gem rather than make a normal attack. This allows you to use the spell gem as if you were a spellcaster with the spell on your class’s spell list.
Unlike the normal rules for using a spell gem, it does not matter if the gem’s item level is higher than your caster level (even if your caster level is 0). However, if the spell gem’s item level is higher than your base attack bonus, once you’ve spent the full action to cast the spell, you must succeed at an attack roll with the weapon against an AC equal to the spell gem’s level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. This roll represents your expertise with the weapon, and no actual attack or ammunition is used. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell is expended harmlessly and the spell gem is destroyed.
";magic;cr-fusion-spellthrower;cr-fusion-spellthrower
CR;195;THUNDERING;9;-;The thundering fusion imbues a weapon with heightened frequency vibrations. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the thundering fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the thundering fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.;magic;cr-fusion-thundering;cr-fusion-thundering
CR;195;TRAILBLAZER;1;-;"A weapon with the trailblazer fusion manages to alter the nature of its attacks to overcome the penalties of some natural environmental effects. Its attacks ignore the cover provided by bogs and the cover creatures submerged at least chest deep in water receive from attacks made from the surface. Fire damage dealt by the weapon to underwater targets does half normal damage (rather than the normal one-quarter), and other attacks made underwater deal full damage (rather than the normal half damage).
Additionally, ranged attack rolls with the weapon don’t take a penalty due to the effects of storms, strong and severe winds, or windstorms. It can even be used to make ranged attacks in severe storms as if they were typical storms and in hurricane- force winds as if they were strong winds.
See Biomes on page 396 for more information on environments that impose attack penalties, and see Underwater Combat on page 405 for rules on attacking submerged targets.
";magic;cr-fusion-trailblazer;cr-fusion-trailblazer
CR;195;UNHOLY;2;-;The unholy fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from an evil deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are evil-aligned. Damage from the weapon overcomes DR/evil and ignores the energy resistance of good dragons and good outsiders. The unholy fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the holy fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-unholy;cr-fusion-unholy
CR;195;VENOMOUS;2;-;A weapon with the venomous fusion gains the injection weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an injection attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is exposed to the drug, medicinal, or poison when you use the injection property in an attack. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-venomous;cr-fusion-venomous
CR;195;VORPAL;10;-;With the vorpal fusion, a weapon can tear between the molecules of a creature. The weapon gains the severe wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the severe wound effect. Only a weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;cr-fusion-vorpal;cr-fusion-vorpal
CR;195;WOUNDING;7;-;The wounding fusion causes a weapon to deal exceptionally traumatic damage. The weapon gains the wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the wound effect.;magic;cr-fusion-wounding;cr-fusion-wounding
AR;62;ACCURATE;5;-;The accurate fusion bestows exceptional balance and handling on a weapon. When you take a move action to aim a weapon with this fusion at a specific target, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll with that weapon provided neither you nor your target has moved since you aimed. You also gain this bonus if you take a move action to aim for other purposes, such as aiming a weapon with the sniper special property. Only ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-accurate;ar-fusion-accurate
AR;62;ADVANCING;6;-;When you defeat a foe, a weapon with the advancing fusion draws you further into the fray. The first time each round that you make a successful melee attack with an advancing weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you can take a guarded step as a reaction. This movement must move you closer to at least one foe.;magic;ar-fusion-advancing;ar-fusion-advancing
AR;62;BENEFICENT;9;-;When you score a critical hit against a significant enemy with a weapon that has the beneficent fusion, you gain one charge of beneficence. As long as you are wielding the same weapon, you can expend a charge of beneficence to cast either remove affliction or lesser remove condition as a spell-like ability, using the weapon’s item level as your caster level. You cannot have more than one charge of beneficence at a time, and you lose all charges of beneficence if you take a 10 minute rest and spend a Resolve Point to regain your Stamina Points or if you take an 8-hour rest and regain your daily-use abilities and spells. If the weapon with the beneficent fusion has an item level of 14 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast remove condition. If the weapon has an item level of 19 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast greater remove condition. A weapon cannot have the beneficent weapon fusion if it also has the unholy or wounding weapon fusions.;magic;ar-fusion-beneficent;ar-fusion-beneficent
AR;62;BOMBARDING;5;-;"The bombarding fusion allows a weapon to duplicate the effect of a single grenade that is loaded into an extradimensional space within the weapon. Loading a grenade into a weapon with the bombarding fusion takes a full round, as does removing a previously loaded grenade. A grenade loaded into a weapon with the bombarding fusion cannot have an item level greater than the weapon’s item level. The grenade cannot be detonated, sundered, or otherwise affected while it is within this extradimensional space, and if the weapon is destroyed or gains the broken condition, the grenade is permanently destroyed.
Once per day, a weapon with the bombarding fusion can launch a mystic version of the loaded grenade. This acts as throwing the grenade, and uses the same proficiency and range increment as throwing a grenade, but does not require a free hand. As long as you are wielding a weapon with the bombarding fusion and it has not yet used this ability, you can launch the grenade as a ranged attack. Once this ability has been used, the loaded grenade can be removed from the extradimensional space, but a new grenade cannot be loaded into it until 24 hours have passed.";magic;ar-fusion-bombarding;ar-fusion-bombarding
AR;62;CHARGE DISRUPTING;7;-;A weapon with the charge disrupting fusion disrupts power sources. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the charge disrupting fusion, either the target or a single visible object carried by the target is subject to discharge, as the spell. The target creature (or its bearer, in the case of an object) can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect, as normal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the charge disrupting effect.;magic;ar-fusion-charge-disrupting;ar-fusion-charge-disrupting
AR;62;CONSERVING;3;-;Weapons with the conserving fusion preserve their ammunition and charges after a miss. When you miss with a ranged attack roll, your charge or ammunition is not consumed, as though the weapon had never been fired. This fusion does not prevent your weapon from malfunctioning or breaking as a consequence of your attack. Only weapons that use arrows, batteries, darts, flares, grenade arrows, mini-rockets, rounds, or scattergun shells as ammunition can benefit from a conserving fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-conserving;ar-fusion-conserving
AR;63;CONTINUOUS;8;-;The continuous fusion lets a weapon with the line special property sustain fire continuously by expending additional charges. When you make a line attack with a weapon with this fusion, you can expend additional ammunition or charges equal to the weapon’s usage value to sustain your attack until the start of your next turn. This has no additional effect on targets already within the line, but anything that moves across your weapon’s line is attacked using your original attack roll and damage. If you hit but fail to damage this new target, it blocks your line as normal. If an existing blockage is removed, your line extends out to its maximum range unless blocked anew, and it can damage creatures and objects that it failed to reach previously. You can’t damage a single target more than once in a round with the continuous fusion, even if it moves in and out of the path of your attack. If you move from where you initiated the attack for any reason, your line automatically ends. Only weapons that can make a line attack benefit from this fusion. You can use the continuous fusion with unwieldy weapons.;magic;ar-fusion-continuous;ar-fusion-continuous
AR;63;CRUEL;6;-;The cruel fusion feeds on fear and despair. When you strike a target that is frightened, panicked, or shaken with a weapon with this fusion, the target is sickened for 1 round. When you make a successful attack that drops a foe (either by killing it or knocking it unconscious), you gain 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes. Weapons with the nonlethal special property cannot benefit from the cruel fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-cruel;ar-fusion-cruel
AR;63;DEFENDING;3;-;"Weapons with the defending fusion aid their wielder when blocking or fighting defensively. When you fight defensively while attacking with a weapon with this fusion, you gain a
+1 bonus to attack rolls with the weapon (effectively reducing the penalty from fighting defensively to –3) and an additional
+1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Additionally, if your weapon has the block weapon special property, increase the enhancement bonus to your AC against melee attacks from that target to +2. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.
";magic;ar-fusion-defending;ar-fusion-defending
AR;63;ENERGETIC;5;-;A projectile weapon with the energetic fusion relies on energy rather than physical ammunition to generate kinetic attacks. Instead of being loaded with darts, rounds, or scattergun shells, the weapon is loaded with a battery. The type of battery the projectile weapon uses depends on its original capacity as follows: 1–20 use batteries, 21–40 use high-capacity batteries, 41–80 use super-capacity batteries, and 81 or more use ultra- capacity batteries. The weapon’s usage does not change, but it takes charges from the installed battery, rather than expending physical ammunition. The fusion converts the energy into physical bullets which target KAC and deal damage normally for the weapon. Only weapons in the projectile category that would normally use darts, rounds, or scattergun shells can benefit from the energetic fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-energetic;ar-fusion-energetic
AR;63;ENSNARING;6;-;The ensnaring fusion binds the target on a critical hit. On a critical hit with this weapon, you can apply the entangle weapon special property (Core Rulebook 181). The entangle effect ends after 1 minute if the target has not already escaped it. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the entangle effect. If you successfully affect a target with both the entangling and ensnaring fusions on the same attack roll, only the ensnaring fusion applies, and your use of the entangling fusion is not consumed. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-ensnaring;ar-fusion-ensnaring
AR;63;GUARDED;8;-;The guarded fusion guides timing so that ranged attacks don’t leave the wielder vulnerable. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon with this fusion, your attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The guarded fusion does not prevent attacks of opportunity provoked for any reason other than making a ranged attack. Only ranged and thrown weapons can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-guarded;ar-fusion-guarded
AR;63;INSPIRING;2;-;The inspiring fusion imbues a weapon with hope. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the inspiring fusion, you and all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against attacks, effects, and spells from the target of your attack for 1 minute. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the inspiring effect.;magic;ar-fusion-inspiring;ar-fusion-inspiring
AR;64;INVIGORATING;1;-;The invigorating fusion fills its wielder with vigor when defeating foes. After making a successful attack with this weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you feel a rush of energy that eliminates the fatigued condition and reduces exhaustion to fatigue. If you were neither exhausted nor fatigued, you instead gain a +3 morale bonus to Strength-, Dexterity- and Constitution-based ability checks and skill checks, and you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your speed for all of your modes of movement until the end of your next turn.;magic;ar-fusion-invigorating;ar-fusion-invigorating
AR;64;LIMNING;5;-;"Successful attacks with a weapon with the limning fusion surround the target with a glowing aura.
For 1 round after you successfully attack a single creature with your weapon, it is surrounded by a pale glow that reveals its location. While so illuminated, the creature takes a –20 penalty to Stealth
checks and does not benefit from concealment provided by
darkness, invisibility, smoke, and similar effects. However, displacement and other effects that shift location entirely are not negated. The light is too dim to harm creatures vulnerable to light and does not serve to illuminate anything but
the creature affected by limning. Limning weapons create glows in a variety of hues, and some even bestow a variety of colors. The limning fusion has no effect on attacks that affect multiple foes.";magic;ar-fusion-limning;ar-fusion-limning
AR;64;MALEDICTION;9;-;Once per day when you successfully attack a foe with a weapon with the malediction fusion, as a reaction you can cast bestow curse on the target as a spell-like ability (using the weapon’s item level as the caster level). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the malediction fusion if it also has either the holy or merciful weapon fusions.;magic;ar-fusion-malediction;ar-fusion-malediction
AR;64;MENACING;6;-;A weapon with the menacing fusion aggressively pushes against your foe’s guard, making way for other attackers. When you hit an enemy with a melee attack using a menacing weapon, that enemy is considered flanked for all other melee attackers until the start of your next turn. This weapon fusion does not provide any benefit to your own attacks. Only melee weapons can benefit from the menacing fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-menacing;ar-fusion-menacing
AR;64;MIND RENDING;7;-;"Scoring a critical hit with a weapon with the mind rending fusion damages the psyche of the creature struck. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save; otherwise, roll on the Psychic Trauma table to determine how the target creature is affected. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or a psychic trauma. Psychic trauma is a mind- affecting effect. While each psychic trauma exploits a potential neurosis, the trauma does not cause actual insanity. The effects of psychic trauma can be removed with the remove affliction spell (DC = 15 + half the item level of the mind rending weapon).

AR;64;NULLIFYING;10;-;Damage from a weapon with the nullifying fusion temporarily reduces spell resistance. When you damage a creature with spell resistance using a weapon with this fusion, its spell resistance is reduced by 2 until the end of your next turn. Multiple hits from weapons with this fusion stack.;magic;ar-fusion-nullifying;ar-fusion-nullifying
AR;64;OBSCURING;5;-;"A weapon with the obscuring fusion emits mist, smoke, or a similar obscuring vapor when wielded. After attacking with the weapon, as a move action you can cause the weapon to emit enough vapor to conceal you until the start of your next turn. This effect ends immediately if you move for any reason from where you made your attack. This concealment does not interfere with your attacks or benefit others, even if they move into the space you attacked from, and you can’t use
it to hide. Conditions such as strong wind or vacuum that quickly disperse vapors negate this concealment. Only projectile weapons or those that deal cold or fire damage can benefit from this fusion.";magic;ar-fusion-obscuring;ar-fusion-obscuring
AR;64;OPPORTUNISTIC;2;-;The opportunistic fusion guides your accuracy when making attacks of opportunity and leaves your foes vulnerable to your attack. You gain a +2 bonus to attacks of opportunity made with this weapon. If your attack of opportunity hits, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll for that attack of opportunity. This damage increases by 1 if the weapon is item level 5, and by an additional 1 for every 5 item levels thereafter. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-opportunistic;ar-fusion-opportunistic
AR;64;POTENT;3;-;The potent fusion boosts the DC of saving throws associated with the weapon. When you attack using a weapon with this fusion, increase the DC for saving throws against the weapon’s critical hit effects, other weapon fusions, weapon special properties, and any effect delivered by the weapon (such as an injected poison) by 1.;magic;ar-fusion-potent;ar-fusion-potent
AR;65;PUNISHINGNG;5;-;Subsequent wounds from a weapon with the punishing fusion have greater effect. When you damage a creature with the weapon, you receive a +1 bonus to damage against that target with this weapon until the end of your turn. If you successfully damage the same creature with this weapon multiple times in the same round, the bonus increases by 1 on each additional attack. If you damage a creature with this weapon when it isn’t your turn, such as with an attack of opportunity, the bonus lasts until the end of your next turn after the attack.;magic;ar-fusion-punishingng;ar-fusion-punishingng
AR;65;REBOUNDING;8;-;The rebounding fusion lets you bounce your attacks off a wall to reach your target. When making a ranged attack, you can ricochet your attack off a single solid barrier into your target. You take a –4 penalty to your attack roll. You must have line of sight to your target, and your target still benefits from any applicable concealment. Calculate cover based on the point you ricochet from. The fusion prevents any damage to the barrier and allows you to carom shots at apparently impossible angles. You can’t ricochet off a barrier your weapon would automatically pass through, such as rebounding a laser off a transparent surface, but you can ricochet off a barrier that your weapon would normally destroy. A thrown weapon with both the rebounding and returning fusions returns as normal, rebounding off the barrier again on its way back to you. Only thrown and ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-rebounding;ar-fusion-rebounding
AR;65;SECURED;1;-;"The secured fusion ties the weapon to a single owner. When you use your weapon, it functions normally, but when wielded by any other, it remains inert and useless. Any analog, nonmagical properties of the weapon that do not require ammunition or charges still function, so a club would still be a club, but a pistol becomes merely an improvised weapon. Only the person who places a secured fusion seal on a weapon can remove it from that weapon. Once removed, the fusion seal can be affixed to a new weapon by a new owner. Even if not the owner, a character trained in Mysticism can remove an installed secured fusion or fusion seal using a process similar to transferring a fusion (Core Rulebook 191). For a fusion, this costs half as much as purchasing the fusion for the weapon on which it is currently installed; for a seal, this is half the cost of the seal itself. The process takes 8 hours. Afterward, a fusion can be installed on a new weapon and assigned a new owner for the installation cost, and a fusion seal can be used normally.";magic;ar-fusion-secured;ar-fusion-secured
AR;65;SELECTIVE;5;-;With the selective weapon fusion, you can exclude a single target from a weapon’s area of effect. When using a selective weapon to make an automatic, blast, explode, line, or other form of area attack that affects multiple targets, you can choose a single target to leave out of the area of effect.;magic;ar-fusion-selective;ar-fusion-selective
AR;65;SOULFIRE;1;-;The soulfire fusion (and soulfire fusion seals) can only be applied to solarian weapon crystals. When you hit a target with a solar weapon augmented by a solarian weapon crystal with the soulfire fusion, you add your Charisma bonus to the damage done, in addition to your Strength bonus.;magic;ar-fusion-soulfire;ar-fusion-soulfire
AR;65;STABILIZING;1;-;The stabilizing fusion helps you keep your orientation in zero gravity. While wielding such a weapon, you can steady yourself even if you don’t have a surface to grab onto or a means of propulsion. If you do have such means, you can steady yourself as either a move action or a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus to checks to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. Only melee weapons, small arms, and long arms can benefit from the stabilizing fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-stabilizing;ar-fusion-stabilizing
AR;65;THROWING;2;-;The throwing fusion makes even the most cumbersome melee weapon usable as a thrown weapon. A melee weapon with this fusion gains the thrown special property with a range increment of 10 feet. If the weapon has an item level of 10 or higher, the range increment is 20 feet. This fusion allows you to add additional fusions that benefit thrown weapons. You must be proficient with a melee weapon with the throwing fusion in order to benefit from the thrown special property granted by it. Only melee weapons can benefit from the throwing fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-throwing;ar-fusion-throwing
AR;65;TRACKING;10;-;"The tracking fusion lets you locate a creature recently damaged by the weapon. Activating the fusion is a move action that binds the tracking fusion to the first creature you damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn. Once you track a target with this fusion, you are aware of the target’s location as long as it is within 1,000 feet and you keep the weapon with this fusion in hand.
If the target is further away, you can attempt a Perception check (opposed by the target creature’s Stealth check) to know approximately what direction the creature is in, though not accurately enough to triangulate its exact location. This is considered a magic divination. The tracking effect is removed if the target travels more than 10 miles away from you, the target changes planes, the effect is dispelled, you fail a Perception check to know its general distance by 10 or more, or 24 hours have passed since you last damaged the target with this weapon. For the purposes of dispelling the tracking effect, treat the effect as a spell with a caster level equal to the weapon’s item level. You can track only one creature at a time. Activating the tracking weapon fusion again automatically ends any previous binding. Only attacks made by the weapon against a single target can benefit from this fusion.

AR;65;VANISHING;4;-;The vanishing fusion can hide its wielder from the sight of one foe. Once per day after making an attack with your weapon, regardless of whether you hit your target, you can become invisible to that target per invisibility for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s item level. Any attacks you make (even against other targets) end your invisibility as normal. All creatures other than the target continue to be able to see you normally. Only small arms and weapons with the operative special property can benefit from this fusion.;magic;ar-fusion-vanishing;ar-fusion-vanishing
