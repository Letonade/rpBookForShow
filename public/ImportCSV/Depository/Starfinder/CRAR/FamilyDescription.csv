CR;199;cr-abadarcorp-travel-suit;Armor;AbadarCorp Travel Suit;Gold, Platinum, Silver;AbadarCorp executives popularized these light armor business suits for boardrooms and diplomatic meetings. Contingent force fields and concealed rebreathers protect the wearer in hostile environmental conditions. Higher grades of travel suits offer more protection—along with a designer label.;cr-abadarcorp-travel-suit;
CR;185;cr-acid-dart-rifle;Weapon;Acid Dart Rifle;Dual, Complex, Tactical;An acid dart rifle has a nonreactive polymer reservoir that can be filled with whatever acid the wielder desires. The automatic loading process fills the rifle darts with acid as they are moved into the chamber. Dual acid dart rifles fire two darts simultaneously, while complex acid dart rifles hold concentrated doses of acid.;cr-acid-dart-rifle;
CR;199;cr-aegis-series;Armor;Aegis Series;Elite, Specialist, Squad;Aegis suits of heavy armor cover wearers entirely, leading to the suits’ nickname of “personal tanks.” Helmet visors are narrow or nonexistent, instead projecting video and audio feeds to the wearer. Power-assisted limbs allow the wearer to move intuitively with the suit on.;cr-aegis-series;
CR;192;cr-fusion-anarchic;WeaponFusion;ANARCHIC;;The anarchic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a chaotic deity. Any attacks with the weapon are chaotic-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/chaotic and ignores the energy resistance of lawful dragons and lawful outsiders. The anarchic fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the axiomatic fusion.;cr-fusion-anarchic;
CR;192;cr-fusion-anchoring;WeaponFusion;ANCHORING;;A weapon with the anchoring fusion has a chance to immobilize its targets. The weapon gains immobilization as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, choose each time whether to apply the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the immobilization effect. A target affected by the immobilization critical hit effect is unable to move from its space under its own power for 1d4 rounds. It cannot use any form of movement, including teleportation effects, to change its position. If the target is entirely contained in a mobile object (such as a starship or large vehicle), the target is immobile relative to its location within that object. Other creatures and forces can move the target normally.;cr-fusion-anchoring;
CR;186;cr-arc-emitter;Weapon;Arc Emitter;Advanced, Tactical;Arc emitters discharge a cone of electrical energy that can damage and stun anyone within its area. Advanced arc emitters can be used at a longer range and are used by military forces to stun and subdue groups of enemies.;cr-arc-emitter;
CR;186;cr-arc-pistol;Weapon;Arc Pistol;Aurora, Static, Storm;Arc pistols fire deadly, stunning blasts of electricity at ranged targets. They have a two-pronged emitter that directs the electrical blast and a bulky chamber that holds the capacitor.;cr-arc-pistol;
CR;186;cr-arc-rifle;Weapon;Arc Rifle;Aurora, Static, Storm, Tempest;Arc rifles fire deadly electrical blasts and have a longer range than arc pistols. Like arc pistols, arc rifles can stun targets that are not killed outright by the electricity damage.;cr-arc-rifle;
CR;190;cr-arrows;BattleWare;Arrows;;Arrow shafts are made of carbon fiber–reinforced plastic and have metal or ceramic heads.;cr-arrows;
CR;184;cr-artillery-laser;Weapon;Artillery Laser;Aphelion, Azimuth, Corona, Parallax, Perihelion, Zenith;Artillery lasers are heavy weapons designed to be effective against hardened targets such as vehicles and enemy bunkers.;cr-artillery-laser;
CR;184;cr-autobeam-artillery;Weapon;Autobeam Artillery;Advanced, Elite, Tactical;Though it lacks the penetrating power of an artillery laser, an autobeam artillery delivers sustained laser fire. It uses a rotating array of lenses to prevent the intense heat of sustained fire from melting the weapon’s housing.;cr-autobeam-artillery;
CR;184;cr-autobeam-rifle;Weapon;Autobeam Rifle;Advanced, Elite, Tactical;Autobeam rifles can fire in automatic mode, spraying a cone of lasers from the barrel.;cr-autobeam-rifle;
CR;185;cr-autotarget-rifle;Weapon;Autotarget Rifle;;An automatic model of the basic rifle, autotarget rifles fire continuously for as long as the trigger is depressed and fresh rounds are available in the magazine.;cr-autotarget-rifle;
CR;192;cr-fusion-axiomatic;WeaponFusion;AXIOMATIC;;The axiomatic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a lawful deity. Any attacks with the weapon are lawful-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/lawful and ignores the energy resistance of chaotic dragons and chaotic outsiders. The axiomatic fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the anarchic fusion.;cr-fusion-axiomatic;
CR;192;cr-fusion-bane;WeaponFusion;BANE;;The bane fusion enhances the power of critical hits against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the bane weapon gains the stunned critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit against an appropriate foe, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the stunned effect. When you add this fusion to a weapon (or create it as a fusion seal), you must select a single creature type (aberration, animal, construct, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, outsider, plant, undead, or vermin) against which it will apply. If you select humanoid or outsider, you must also select one subtype. The stunned critical hit effect applies only against creatures of the selected type (and subtype, if selected). Once selected, the creature type and subtype can’t be changed.;cr-fusion-bane;
CR;184;cr-baton;Weapon;Baton;Advanced, Tactical;A baton is a thin, solid metal shaft, usually with a textured rubber grip. A tactical baton can be used to inflict precise bludgeoning blows. An advanced baton, used by elite mercenary and security companies, often has an additional shaft, as well as a weighted end that can be powered to connect with substantially more force than a tactical baton.;cr-baton;
CR;190;cr-battery;BattleWare;Battery;High-Capacity, Super-Capacity, Ultra-Capacity;Batteries charge powered weapons, but they can also be used to power an array of items, including powered armor and technological items. Batteries have a standardized size and weight, and items that take batteries all have a slot into which they fit, regardless of the item’s actual size. Weapons that use batteries list the highest-capacity battery they are capable of using as well as how many charges from the battery that each shot consumes.;cr-battery;
CR;204;cr-battle-harness;PowArmor;Battle Harness;;The battle harness is the basic powered armor frame used by infantry units in professional militaries.;cr-battle-harness;
CR;187;cr-battleglove;Weapon;Battleglove;Cestus, Gravity, Nova, Power;Battlegloves are popular, economical choices for mercenaries and guards. These durable nylon-web or para-aramid gloves hold a weighted plate over the wearer’s knuckles. You can hold other objects or weapons in a hand wearing a glove, but you can’t use the glove to make attacks while doing so.;cr-battleglove;
CR;192;cr-fusion-blasting;WeaponFusion;BLASTING;;The blasting fusion allows a weapon to make a single attack as a blast (see the blast weapon special property on page 180) once per day as a full action. This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon’s normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don’t have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the blasting fusion. Weapons that don’t require attack rolls to affect their targets also can’t benefit from the blasting fusion.;cr-fusion-blasting;
CR;193;cr-fusion-bleeding;WeaponFusion;BLEEDING;;The bleeding fusion weaves entropic energy into the weapon’s form. The weapon gains the bleed critical hit effect (see page 182). The amount of damage taken each round from this effect is equal to 1d6 per 5 levels of the weapon, rounded down. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the bleed effect. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can have this fusion.;cr-fusion-bleeding;
CR;187;cr-bow;Weapon;Bow;;Modern compound bows are made of aluminum alloys, for superior lightness and durability. The string is made of high- performance polyethylene. Bows fire arrows as ammunition, and they can also be used with grenade arrows for more customized damage and effects.;cr-bow;
CR;193;cr-fusion-burst;WeaponFusion;BURST;;With the burst fusion, a weapon’s energy damage can form a small explosion that spills onto a second target. The weapon gains the arc critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the arc effect. The amount of damage dealt to the secondary target is equal to one-third the level of the weapon with the burst fusion (minimum 1). Only weapons that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage can benefit from a burst fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you select one of those types for the arc critical hit effect to apply to secondary targets when the fusion is added.;cr-fusion-burst;
CR;193;cr-fusion-called;WeaponFusion;CALLED;;A weapon with the called fusion can be teleported to its owner’s hand as a swift action, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A weapon with the called fusion must be in your possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function.;cr-fusion-called;
CR;199;cr-carbon-skin;Armor;Carbon Skin;Diamond, Graphite, Nanotube, White Carbon;Though these suits of light armor appear to be made of stiff fabric, they are actually woven from carbon fibers. Higher-quality carbon skins are reinforced with carbon allotypes, such as white carbon or diamond, and the heightened sheen of the fabric hints at their expensive construction.;cr-carbon-skin;
CR;187;cr-carbonedge-shuriken;Weapon;Carbonedge Shuriken;;The four-armed kasathas favor thrown weapons, so they are the most common users of these finely edged projectiles. Users of thrown weapons appreciate the light weight and keen edges of carbonedge shuriken.;cr-carbonedge-shuriken;
CR;204;cr-cargo-lifter;PowArmor;Cargo Lifter;;A cargo lifter consists of a simple metal frame atop slow-moving legs or treads. Rather than having articulated hands, its arms end in specialized gripping tools meant to lift bulky containers. A cargo lifter can’t use weapons and takes a –4 penalty to all attack rolls. It can carry 10 bulk more than normal for its Strength score without becoming encumbered or overburdened.;cr-cargo-lifter;
CR;199;cr-ceremonial-plate;Armor;Ceremonial Plate;Commander, Officer, Troop;While this heavy armor of sculpted metal plates offers good protection to the wearer, its main purpose is to intimidate enemies. Often used for honor guards, military exercises, or parades, ceremonial plate is usually brightly colored or made of shining metal, with elaborate helmets.;cr-ceremonial-plate;
CR;187;cr-club;Weapon;Club;;"A club is any sort of blunt, oblong instrument with a haft suitable for gripping. Clubs can be made of stone, wood, or similar materials. Metal clubs exist as well, and they are usually hollow to keep them from being too heavy. Some Free Captains refer to clubs as belaying pins, though those archaic items are
not required on starships.
";cr-club;
CR;185;cr-combat-rifle;Weapon;Combat Rifle;;This utilitarian rifle is favored by mercenaries who aren’t looking for flashy weapons.;cr-combat-rifle;
CR;193;cr-fusion-corrosive;WeaponFusion;CORROSIVE;;The corrosive fusion weaves the destructive power of acid into the weapon’s form. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with acid damage. You can activate or deactivate the corrosive fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with acid (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the corrosive fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal acid damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;cr-fusion-corrosive;
CR;185;cr-crossbolter;Weapon;Crossbolter;Advanced, Dual, Elite, Paragon, Tactical;This weapon resembles a rifle with a crossbeam near the end of the barrel. A crossbolter uses mechanical power to fire arrows along the barrel. Grenade arrows can also be fired with a crossbolter.;cr-crossbolter;
CR;183;cr-cryo-grenade;BattleWare;Cryo Grenade;I–IV;Cryo grenades release a blast of supercooled chemicals on impact, which immediately coalesce into freezing particles.;cr-cryo-grenade;
CR;183;cr-cryopike;Weapon;Cryopike;Advanced, Tactical;The haft of a cryopike is a long aluminum or carbon-steel shaft with an adjustable rubber grip. A cryopike emits a blast of supercooled gas from its tip that acts as a freezing blade.;cr-cryopike;
CR;187;cr-curve-blade;Weapon;Curve Blade;Buzzblade, Carbon Steel, Dimensional Slice, Ultrathin;"This graceful, curving blade further increases the drama inherent in sword fighting. Carbon steel blades bite deeply, causing bleeding wounds. The blade of an ultrathin curve blade looks delicate, but it is as
hard as carbon steel and keeps a fine edge. Buzzblade curve blades vibrate when powered, tearing organic flesh and
causing additional bleed damage. Dimensional slice curve blades have only a narrow visible blade area, surrounded by a solid aura; these are the sharpest and most
dangerous curve blades on the market.
";cr-curve-blade;
CR;184;cr-dagger;Weapon;Dagger;Molecular Rift, Ultrathin, Zero-Edge;"The thinness and lightness of daggers make them easy to carry or conceal. Ultrathin daggers have sharp, double-edged blades. Zero-edge daggers have blades—crafted with quantum technology—that are so fine, their edges blur. The blade of a molecular rift dagger looks translucent, as if it’s made of glass, and its vibrating particles allow the dagger to slice through almost any substance. Most daggers are available with fixed, folding, or retractable blades.
";cr-dagger;
CR;190;cr-darts;BattleWare;Darts;;These light metal shafts each have a pointed tip and a reservoir to hold toxins or other appropriate substances that are typically liquid or viscous. While most combatants rely on darts to deliver toxins to enemies, particularly desperate or overworked field medics sometimes employ darts to conveniently deliver antitoxins, healing serums, and other beneficial drugs across a crowded battlefield. In these cases, medics often practice to improve their aim to ensure that this strategy is effective when employed.;cr-darts;
CR;193;cr-fusion-deafening;WeaponFusion;DEAFENING;;With the deafening fusion, a weapon releases a blast of low- frequency sonic energy on impact. The weapon gains the deafen critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the deafen effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage can benefit from a deafening fusion.;cr-fusion-deafening;
CR;199;cr-defiance-series;Armor;Defiance Series;Elite, Specialist, Squad;The defiance series of heavy armor is the workhorse of squad armor. A formed hard shell overlays a suit of para-aramids, creating a bulky and solid protective outfit. Defiance series helmets have wide, tinted visors to allow peripheral vision.;cr-defiance-series;
CR;193;cr-fusion-defiant;WeaponFusion;DEFIANT;;A weapon with the defiant fusion resists efforts to be removed from its wielder. If you are wielding it when you are knocked unconscious, panicked, or stunned, it stays in your hand. You also gain a bonus to your KAC against combat maneuvers to disarm the weapon equal to one-fifth the weapon’s level (minimum +1).;cr-fusion-defiant;
CR;199;cr-defrex-hide;Armor;Defrex Hide;;Made from the hide of a ferocious mammal native to Vesk-2, this light armor is popular among vesk but less often worn by other races. Tanned stretches of the creature’s thick hide are stitched together with metal wires, and the suits are reinforced with metal studs or scales.;cr-defrex-hide;
CR;193;cr-fusion-devastating;WeaponFusion;DEVASTATING;;You can apply the devastating fusion only to a weapon with two or more critical hit effects. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has the devastating fusion, you can select two of the critical hit effects to apply to the target (even if you are normally required to select just one critical hit effect).;cr-fusion-devastating;
CR;187;cr-devastation-blade;Weapon;Devastation Blade;Apocalypse, Ruin, Wrack;The overlarge devastation blade is a two-edged sword that creates terrifying wounds. Devastation blades are rarely subtle weapons, due to both their size and their often elaborate spiked designs.;cr-devastation-blade;
CR;193;cr-fusion-dispelling;WeaponFusion;DISPELLING;;A weapon with the dispelling fusion gathers spare wisps of latent magic during combat, which it can then unleash in a focused effort to dispel magic. The weapon gains dispelling as a critical hit effect in combat. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, so you must be in combat and facing a significant enemy (see page 242) for it to gain this critical hit effect. If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access the critical hit effect, the GM decides. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted dispel magic, as the spell, using the weapon’s item level as the dispel check’s caster level.;cr-fusion-dispelling;
CR;193;cr-fusion-disruptive;WeaponFusion;DISRUPTIVE;;The disruptive fusion imbues a weapon with powerful positive energy designed to disrupt the magical forces that allow undead to exist. The weapon ignores any DR and energy resistance of undead creatures. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.;cr-fusion-disruptive;
CR;187;cr-doshko;Weapon;Doshko;Advanced, Dimensional Blade, Molecular Rift, Tactical, Ultrathin, Zero-Edge;"The traditional weapon of the vesk, the doshko is composed of one to four triangular blades arranged in a row and attached to a long haft. Ideal for devastating overhand blows and catching and parrying enemy weapons, its use is a highly respected art form in traditional vesk society, but it also sees use by creatures of other races as a variant axe. Traditionally, doshkos are made of steel, but in recent decades they have been crafted using advanced metallurgic techniques and even quantum technology to improve the stabbing edges.
Ultrathin doshko blades look exceptionally delicate but hold a fine edge. Zero-edge doshkos appear to have a blurred edge, while molecular rift doshkos have translucent blades. Dimensional blade doshkos have a narrower visible blade, but the solid surrounding aura makes them vicious weapons.
";cr-doshko;
CR;199;cr-d-suit;Armor;D-Suit;I-VI;Disembarkment suits, or d-suits, are designed for spacefarers who expect to leave their ship and visit a planet’s surface. Most d-suits are jumpsuits or flight suits worn under reinforced breeches, heavy boots, and a thick jacket. A helmet or rebreather and a utility belt with an attached holster complete the outfit.;cr-d-suit;
CR;187;cr-dueling-sword;Weapon;Dueling Sword;Buzzblade, Molecular Rift, Ripper, Tactical, Ultrathin;While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect. The powered blades of both buzzblade and ripper dueling swords bring this danger into the modern era, while the molecular rift sword—though unpowered— uses a field of disrupted molecules along its blade to slice through nearly anything, and must be stored in a magnetic sheath that never actually touches the blade.;cr-dueling-sword;
CR;194;cr-fusion-durable;WeaponFusion;DURABLE;;The durable fusion uses magical runes and reinforcements to significantly increase a weapon’s toughness. When determining a weapon’s hardness, Hit Points, and saving throws, treat its item level as being 5 higher. For more about calculating these values, see Breaking Objects on page 409.;cr-fusion-durable;
CR;199;cr-echelon-fashion;Armor;Echelon Fashion;Bespoke, Ready to Wear;Modeled after the universe’s most cutting-edge fashions, this lightly armored clothing is available in daring modern designs, using force fields and the highest-tech fibers to create any sort of outfit imaginable. Bespoke echelon fashions are often tailor- made for the orderer and meant to look unique.;cr-echelon-fashion;
CR;199;cr-enginerunner;Armor;Enginerunner;;The ysoki popularized this seemingly lightweight but incredibly durable heavy armor. Small squares of dense metal lie between two layers of reinforced fiber weave, giving the appearance of a padded flight suit but offering considerably more protection.;cr-enginerunner;
CR;194;cr-fusion-entangling;WeaponFusion;ENTANGLING;;A weapon with the entangling fusion gains the entangle weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an entangle attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is affected by the entangle condition. The entangle effect ends after 1d4 rounds if the target has not already escaped it. Only weapons that do bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or cold damage can benefit from this fusion.;cr-fusion-entangling;
CR;199;cr-estex-suit;Armor;Estex Suit;I-IV;Estex is a thick, durable fabric most often used to make flight suits and environmental suits. Estex suits cover the wearer from the neck down and can be modified with armor upgrades as needed. Higher-quality estex suits grant a better level of protection and allow for more upgrades, though they are often bulkier than comparable suits of light armor.;cr-estex-suit;
CR;189;cr-fangblade;Weapon;Fangblade;;Cheaper and less elegant than a ripper dueling sword, a fangblade is closer to an industrial chainsaw, with a toothed, motor-driven chain wrapped around its blade.;cr-fangblade;
CR;183;cr-flame-doshko;Weapon;Flame Doshko;Blaze, Ember, Inferno, Solar Flare;When activated, the blade of this doshko heats up by means of internal heating coils. The doshko deals fire damage and can also cause traumatic injuries.;cr-flame-doshko;
CR;183;cr-flame-pistol;Weapon;Flame Pistol;;A flame pistol shoots a line of ignited petrol from its barrel.;cr-flame-pistol;
CR;183;cr-flame-rifle;Weapon;Flame Rifle;;A flame rifle shoots a line of ignited petrol from its barrel.;cr-flame-rifle;
CR;183;cr-flamethrower;Weapon;Flamethrower;Firedrake-Class, Hellhound-Class, Ifrit- Class, Phoenix-Class, Salamander-Class;These portable flamethrowers consist of a heavy rifle-like design with an oversized petrol tank integrated into the weapon’s stock.;cr-flamethrower;
CR;194;cr-fusion-flaming;WeaponFusion;FLAMING;;The flaming fusion imbues a weapon with the fiery power of a star. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with fire damage. You can activate or deactivate the flaming fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with fire (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the flaming fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal fire damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;cr-fusion-flaming;
CR;190;cr-flare;BattleWare;Flare;;Usually made of magnesium, flares burn brightly and can deliver some heat. You can ignite a flare by hand without the need for a flare gun. A lit flare burns for 1 hour, and it can be wielded in melee combat as an improvised weapon that deals 1d2 fire damage.;cr-flare;
CR;183;cr-flare-gun-survival;Weapon;Flare Gun, Survival;;A survival flare gun is used to signal danger or call for help. Though not designed for combat, survival flare guns can deal fire damage at close range.;cr-flare-gun-survival;
CR;184;cr-flash-grenade;BattleWare;Flash Grenade;I–IV;When detonated, a flash grenade releases a pulse of intense radiance.;cr-flash-grenade;
CR;204;cr-flight-frame;PowArmor;Flight Frame;;This massive, sleek machine is shaped like a person and equipped with powerful thrusters built into the feet and attached to the back, giving it a fly speed with average maneuverability.;cr-flight-frame;
CR;184;cr-frag-grenade;BattleWare;Frag Grenade;I–VIII;A fragmentary, or frag, grenade explodes in a cloud of shrapnel.;cr-frag-grenade;
CR;199;cr-freebooter-armor;Armor;Freebooter Armor;I-V;Popularized by the Free Captains of the Diaspora, freebooter armor features an armored jacket or breastplate, heavy boots and gloves, numerous straps and hidden weapons, and a helmet. Novice explorers and mercenaries beginning their career sometimes choose freebooter armor for the air of rakish experience this light armor lends its wearer.;cr-freebooter-armor;
CR;194;cr-fusion-frost;WeaponFusion;FROST;;The frost fusion imbues a weapon with the icy cold of a dead world far from its system’s sun. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with cold damage. You can activate or deactivate the frost fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with cold (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the frost fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal cold damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.;cr-fusion-frost;
CR;194;cr-fusion-ghost-killer;WeaponFusion;GHOST KILLER;;Attacks from a weapon with this fusion deal full damage to incorporeal creatures. They also pass into the Ethereal Plane, allowing such attacks to affect ethereal creatures normally. Weapons with the ghost killer fusion can also score critical hits against incorporeal creatures. In addition, an incorporeal creature (though not an ethereal one) can pick up, move, or wield a ghost killer weapon.;cr-fusion-ghost-killer;
CR;194;cr-fusion-glamered;WeaponFusion;GLAMERED;;As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.;cr-fusion-glamered;
CR;186;cr-gluon-crystal;Weapon;Gluon Crystal;Greater, Lesser, Minor, Standard, True;Gluon crystals create an entropic field along the weapon that creates traumatic wounds.;cr-gluon-crystal;
CR;199;cr-golemforged-plating;Armor;Golemforged Plating;I-V;An economical choice for many mercenaries, golemforged plating is one of the universe’s most popular heavy armors. Golemforged plating consists of a close-fitting polycarbonate suit fitted with ports and sockets to fit most armor customization options. Suits of golemforged plating include flexible boots and gloves as well as a standard helmet with a clear visor.;cr-golemforged-plating;
CR;186;cr-graviton-crystal;Weapon;Graviton Crystal;Greater, Lesser, Minor, Standard, True;Graviton crystals accelerate the impact of a weapon, dealing extra damage and potentially knocking down targets.;cr-graviton-crystal;
CR;190;cr-grenade-arrow;BattleWare;Grenade Arrow;I–IV;The explosive tip of the arrow detonates on impact. A grenade arrow can be made using any handheld grenade. The miniaturized technology incorporated into the arrow increases its price substantially over an equivalent grenade.;cr-grenade-arrow;
CR;189;cr-grindblade;Weapon;Grindblade;;The sharp edge of a grindblade has been crafted with advanced micropitting technology that turns it into a destructive rasp at close to the molecular level, capable of inflicting hideous damage. So sharp and savage is their edge that most grindblade designers don’t even bother giving them a point.;cr-grindblade;
CR;185;cr-gyrojet-pistol;Weapon;Gyrojet Pistol;Advanced, Elite, Tactical;Gyrojet pistols fire mini-rockets that can hit with a force great enough to knock down targets. Gyrojet pistols are slightly larger than semiautomatic pistols, and they have a reinforced barrel.;cr-gyrojet-pistol;
CR;185;cr-gyrojet-rifle;Weapon;Gyrojet Rifle;Advanced, Elite, Paragon, Tactical;The longarm model of a gyrojet pistol, a gyrojet rifle fires mini- rockets with devastating force.;cr-gyrojet-rifle;
CR;189;cr-hammer;Weapon;Hammer;Assault, Comet, Gravity Well, Meteoric;Assault hammers have heavily weighted metal heads and relatively light aluminum or polycarbonate grips. Hammer heads can be custom-made with designs or logos imprinted on the surface. Comet, gravity well, and meteoric hammers have weighted or pneumatically driven heads that deliver accelerated blows.;cr-hammer;
CR;199;cr-hardlight-series;Armor;Hardlight Series;Elite, Specialist, Squad;The last word in light infantry armor, hardlight series armor features an inflexible, lightweight breastplate, limb guards, and a helmet over a smooth and formfitting jumpsuit. Manufacturers often make custom armor for military organizations, but off-the- rack armor of differing qualities is also available to mercenaries and explorers.;cr-hardlight-series;
CR;199;cr-hidden-soldier-armor;Armor;Hidden Soldier Armor;;Made by the kasatha, these suits of heavy armor are so named for their slitted helmets, which reveal only the eyes. A rebreather lets the wearer keep their faces completely covered. A ceramic breastplate, shoulder guards, bracers, and greaves protect the wearer while facilitating the graceful kasathan close-combat style.;cr-hidden-soldier-armor;
CR;194;cr-fusion-holy;WeaponFusion;HOLY;;A weapon with the holy fusion becomes blessed with divine energy from a good deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are good-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/good and ignores the energy resistance of evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead. The holy fusion cannot be added to weapons that have the unholy fusion.;cr-fusion-holy;
CR;185;cr-hunting-rifle;Weapon;Hunting Rifle;;This basic rifle is used mainly for personal defense and hunting. More advanced rifles have military uses.;cr-hunting-rifle;
CR;194;cr-fusion-hybridized;WeaponFusion;HYBRIDIZED;;A weapon with the hybridized fusion replaces much of its technological functions with magic counterparts. It gains the analog weapon special property (see page 180), and the core function of the weapon is considered to be a hybrid of magic and technology (rather than only the fusion counting as a hybrid item). A hybridized weapon still consumes ammunition and battery charges normally.;cr-fusion-hybridized;
CR;194;cr-fusion-illuminating;WeaponFusion;ILLUMINATING;;The illuminating fusion causes a weapon to gain the bright weapon special property (see page 181). You can deactivate this fusion as a move action, in which case the weapon acts as if it does not have the bright property until it is reactivated (which also requires a move action).;cr-fusion-illuminating;
CR;189;cr-imds-missile-launcher;Weapon;IMDS Missile Launcher;;IMDS (an acronym for “individual missile delivery system”) missile launchers are the most common missile launchers currently on the market.

CR;185;cr-knife;Weapon;Knife;Survival, Tactical;"These light blades can be used for both mundane tasks and combat. A typical survival knife has a fixed, single-edged, carbon- steel or ceramic blade and is treated against corrosion. Tactical knives have large, double-edged blades, often with a section of serrated blade near the haft, and they come in both fixed- and folding-blade designs; users may prefer one style or the other, but the two are identical in terms of price, weight, and damage dealt.";cr-knife;
CR;194;cr-fusion-knockdown;WeaponFusion;KNOCKDOWN;;With the knockdown fusion, a weapon disrupts a target’s center of gravity. The weapon gains the knockdown critical hit effect (see page 182).

CR;194;cr-fusion-merciful;WeaponFusion;MERCIFUL;;A weapon with the merciful fusion often hums pleasantly when at rest and makes soft, airy musical noises when it is used to make an attack. The magic of this fusion subdues the damaging effect of the weapon it is added to. While this fusion is active, the weapon’s regular damage becomes nonlethal damage. If the weapon deals two types of damage, both of the damage types become nonlethal. You can activate or deactivate the merciful fusion as a swift action.;cr-fusion-merciful;

CR;194;cr-fusion-ominous;WeaponFusion;OMINOUS;;A weapon with the ominous fusion trails a shadowy haze behind it and moans a menacing dirge in battle. The weapon gains intimidation as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the intimidation effect. A target affected by the intimidation critical hit effect is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). A creature that gains the shaken condition from a weapon with the ominous fusion can’t gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.;cr-fusion-ominous;
CR;185;cr-peacemaker;Weapon;Peacemaker;;This more advanced combat baton, known as a peacemaker, is a light metal rod that discharges a pulse that can be strong enough to knock a target to the ground.;cr-peacemaker;
CR;190;cr-petrol-tank;BattleWare;Petrol Tank;High-Capacity, Standard;Petrol is a highly flammable blend of hydrocarbons that is used in flame weapons (and petrol is occasionally used by desperate adventurers as fuel or for other various utilitarian purposes).

CR;186;cr-reaction-cannon;Weapon;Reaction Cannon;Advanced, Elite, Heavy, Light, Paragon, Tactical;An ancient yet still popular vesk weapon, the reaction cannon uses advanced materials and technology to redirect the recoil of a projectile back into the projectile itself, making it an extremely damaging heavy weapon.;cr-reaction-cannon;
CR;195;cr-fusion-returning;WeaponFusion;RETURNING;;You can add this fusion only to a weapon that has the thrown weapon special property. A returning weapon flies through the air back to you after you make a thrown ranged attack with it. It returns to you just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching the weapon when it comes back takes no action. If you can’t catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which you threw it.;cr-fusion-returning;
CR;190;cr-rounds;BattleWare;Rounds;Heavy, Longarm and Sniper, Small Arm;Cased rounds are housed in magazines, which can be fitted into the appropriate weapon.;cr-rounds;
CR;186;cr-scattergun;Weapon;Scattergun;Grapeshot, Impact, Snub, Utility, Vortex;A scattergun fires fragmentary shells in a spray from its barrel, dealing damage to all targets in range.

CR;186;cr-seeker-rifle;Weapon;Seeker Rifle;Advanced, Elite, Paragon, Tactical;Seeker rifles are single-shot projectile weapons. The line gained its name from korasha lashunta explorers, who favor the rifle for its reliability in hostile terrain.;cr-seeker-rifle;
CR;195;cr-fusion-seeking;WeaponFusion;SEEKING;;The seeking fusion causes an attack from a weapon to veer toward its target. This negates any miss chance caused by the target having concealment, though it has no effect on miss chances from other sources (and does not offset the miss chance from a target having total concealment).;cr-fusion-seeking;
CR;186;cr-semi-auto-pistol;Weapon;Semi-Auto Pistol;Advanced, Elite, Paragon, Tactical;The semiautomatic mechanism of this pistol discharges spent cartridges and reloads fresh ones in the barrel, provided a cartridge remains in the magazine.;cr-semi-auto-pistol;
CR;186;cr-shirren-eye-rifle;Weapon;Shirren-Eye Rifle;Advanced, Elite, Paragon, Tactical, Warpshot;Shirren-eye rifles are named for their compound sights, which resemble the eyes of the insectile race, but are rarely manufactured by shirren companies. Shirren-eye rifles are extremely accurate and favored by snipers and sharpshooters.;cr-shirren-eye-rifle;
CR;195;cr-fusion-shock;WeaponFusion;SHOCK;;The shock fusion weaves the electrical energy of the universe into the weapon’s form. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with electricity damage. You can activate or deactivate the shock fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with electricity (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the shock fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal electricity damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.;cr-fusion-shock;
CR;186;cr-shock-caster;Weapon;Shock Caster;Aurora, Static, Storm, Tempest;Shock casters fire a blast of electrical energy that explodes when it impacts, creating an electrical storm that can damage and stun anyone within its radius.;cr-shock-caster;

CR;202;cr-shotalashu-armor;Armor;Shotalashu Armor;;The lashunta shotalashu cavalry wear this protective gear while riding their bonded saurian mounts. Layers of thin, ablative plates make for light armor that moves with the rider while providing maximum protection. Military merchants have taken to creating knock-off shotalashu armor in more modern styles, as some of the traditional nature themes are no longer fashionable.;cr-shotalashu-armor;
CR;202;cr-skyfire-armor;Armor;Skyfire Armor;Exident, Pinion;These suits of interlocking metal and ceramic plates are usually highly decorated. Gold trim, exaggerated shoulder guards, and stylized Skyfire logos on the breastplates are common. These iconic outfits are worn by the storied members of the Skyfire Legion, though other groups and individuals have copied the Legion’s distinctively decorated heavy armor. Skyfire armor ordinarily comes with force fields that encase the wearer’s head when needed.;cr-skyfire-armor;
CR;183;cr-skyfire-sword;Weapon;Skyfire Sword;Inferno, Tactical;Originally, these swords were known by their manufacturing ID, BSB–1750. Their popularity with the Skyfire Legion led to their colloquial name, Skyfire swords. Vents for burning gas jets line one edge of the hollow blade. When powered, magnetic fields contain and ignite the gases into a glowing corona of flames.;cr-skyfire-sword;
CR;184;cr-smoke-grenade;BattleWare;Smoke Grenade;;"A smoke grenade deals no damage; instead, it releases a cloud of dense smoke. Each character who inhales smoke must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing; he can do nothing else. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. (Active environmental protection from a suit of armor prevents this effect altogether.) Regardless of the armor a character wears, smoke obscures vision, granting concealment to anyone within it.";cr-smoke-grenade;
CR;187;cr-sonic-pistol;Weapon;Sonic Pistol;Banshee, HFD, LFD, Thunderstrike;"Sonic pistols have a stocky barrel capped
with a concave resonating chamber that amplifies and directs its sonic blast. They use high-intensity sound to shake molecules apart.

CR;187;cr-sonic-rifle;Weapon;Sonic Rifle;Banshee, HFD, LFD, Thunderstrike;A sonic rifle fires a blast that is loud enough to deafen targets in addition to damaging them. Sonic rifles have snub-nosed barrels and typically incorporate U-shaped prongs to improve beam stability.;cr-sonic-rifle;
CR;190;cr-spear;Weapon;Spear;Buzzblade, Gravity, Sentinel, Tactical, Zero-Edge;Spears come in many varieties. Buzzblade spears vibrate at high frequency. Zero-edge spears employ quantum manufacturing to hone an edge so fine that it seems indistinct. The gravity spear uses a tiny gravity field generator to accelerate the weapon at the moment of impact.;cr-spear;
CR;195;cr-fusion-spellthrower;WeaponFusion;SPELLTHROWER;;"A weapon with the spellthrower fusion is able to have a single spell gem loaded into it at a time. It takes 1 minute to load a spell gem, and only gems containing a spell with a casting time of one standard action or less and a spell level no greater than one-quarter the weapon’s item level can be loaded into the weapon.
If you are proficient with and wielding the weapon, as a full action you can cast the spell contained within the spell gem rather than make a normal attack. This allows you to use the spell gem as if you were a spellcaster with the spell on your class’s spell list.
Unlike the normal rules for using a spell gem, it does not matter if the gem’s item level is higher than your caster level (even if your caster level is 0). However, if the spell gem’s item level is higher than your base attack bonus, once you’ve spent the full action to cast the spell, you must succeed at an attack roll with the weapon against an AC equal to the spell gem’s level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. This roll represents your expertise with the weapon, and no actual attack or ammunition is used. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell is expended harmlessly and the spell gem is destroyed.

CR;190;cr-staff;Weapon;Staff;Battle, Carbon, Hardlight, Repeller, Sentinel;"Staves are long and flexible, weighted on the end to provide extra striking power. Most staves are made from aluminum or fiberglass, though some are still made from wood.
Sentinel and repeller staves are made of conductive metal and deliver a painful, low-voltage charge that can stun opponents. The hardlight staff uses a core of unstable photonic gel to dramatically increase its mass every time it strikes a surface.
";cr-staff;
CR;190;cr-starknife;Weapon;Starknife;Accelerated, Dimensional Slice, Lightspeed, Sintered, Tactical;Four tapered metal blades surround the central ring of a starknife, which can be thrown or used to stab opponents. Accelerated and lightspeed starknives have gas-powered jets that fire when the starknife is wielded. Solid auras surround the blades of a dimensional slice starknife, which are manufactured with cutting-edge metallurgic techniques. In a sintered starknife, the metal blades are replaced with compressed ceramic blades.;cr-starknife;
CR;202;cr-stationwear;Armor;Stationwear;Business, Casual, Elite, Flight Suit;Many types of reinforced clothing afford protection without sacrificing comfort or fashion. The prevalence of this kind of light armor on Absalom Station has led to the colloquial term “stationwear.” Stationwear ranges in style from casual wear to business suits and more formal garb. The usual environmental protections of armor are concealed in the design of these outfits. The grades of armor—business, casual, elite, and flight suit—refer to the quality of the garments, not the style.;cr-stationwear;
CR;202;cr-steelbones;Armor;Steelbones;;A framework of metal ribs covers this suit of heavy armor. Force fields bridge the gaps between the metal ribs, which give the armor the macabre look of a metal skeleton. Officers of the Corpse Fleet favor this armor for its unsettling appearance, but steelbones can be worn by anyone who values an intimidating style.;cr-steelbones;
CR;186;cr-stellar-cannon;Weapon;Stellar Cannon;Heavy, Light;A stellar cannon is a portable, handheld cannon that fires exploding shells filled with dense flechettes that shred nearby targets. Stellar cannons have a limited range, but they deal traumatic damage to large areas.;cr-stellar-cannon;

CR;187;cr-streetsweeper;Weapon;Streetsweeper;HFD, LFD, Thunderstrike;Streetsweepers are sonic weapons designed to deliver a low-intensity “punch” of sound. A streetsweeper can be overcharged to deliver a significant sonic blast that can knock down its target.;cr-streetsweeper;
CR;202;cr-swarmsuit;Armor;Swarmsuit;;Inspired by Swarm technology and designed specifically for shirrens, a swarmsuit is a collection of ablative plates backed with reinforced padding and linked with mesh straps. The light armor’s unique arrangement makes it perfect for creatures with unusual physiologies. The wearer arranges the straps in a comfortable formation and slides the ablative plates to cover vulnerable areas.;cr-swarmsuit;
CR;190;cr-swoop-hammer;Weapon;Swoop Hammer;Advanced, Mach I, Mach II, Mach III, Tactical;The combat head of a swoop hammer is affixed to an elongated haft. The extra reach of the haft allows for a greater swinging arc and accelerated damage.;cr-swoop-hammer;
CR;190;cr-taclash;Weapon;Taclash;Numbing, Standard;A tactical lash, or taclash as it is commonly called, is a length of nylon cord reinforced with carbon fibers. Taclashes were originally used by military organizations as a form of crowd control, and explorers and mercenaries came to appreciate the utility of the weapon. When a numbing taclash connects, a low electrical shock transmits through the lash. The shock is too mild to deal damage, but it can stun the target.;cr-taclash;
CR;202;cr-thinplate;Armor;Thinplate;;Devised by androids, thinplate is a dense polyethylene layer that looks lightweight while providing significant protection. This type of heavy armor is thin enough to be worn under loose outfits, but the rigid polyethylene restricts movement and slows the wearer. Thinplate can be molded into a variety of styles, though a simple breastplate plus limb guards is the most common form.;cr-thinplate;
CR;195;cr-fusion-thundering;WeaponFusion;THUNDERING;;The thundering fusion imbues a weapon with heightened frequency vibrations. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the thundering fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the thundering fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.;cr-fusion-thundering;
CR;195;cr-fusion-trailblazer;WeaponFusion;TRAILBLAZER;;"A weapon with the trailblazer fusion manages to alter the nature of its attacks to overcome the penalties of some natural environmental effects. Its attacks ignore the cover provided by bogs and the cover creatures submerged at least chest deep in water receive from attacks made from the surface. Fire damage dealt by the weapon to underwater targets does half normal damage (rather than the normal one-quarter), and other attacks made underwater deal full damage (rather than the normal half damage).
Additionally, ranged attack rolls with the weapon don’t take a penalty due to the effects of storms, strong and severe winds, or windstorms. It can even be used to make ranged attacks in severe storms as if they were typical storms and in hurricane- force winds as if they were strong winds.
See Biomes on page 396 for more information on environments that impose attack penalties, and see Underwater Combat on page 405 for rules on attacking submerged targets.
";cr-fusion-trailblazer;
CR;190;cr-unarmed-strike;Weapon;Unarmed Strike;;An unarmed strike can be dealt with any limb or appendage. Unarmed strikes deal nonlethal damage, and the damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus to weapon damage rolls.;cr-unarmed-strike;
CR;195;cr-fusion-unholy;WeaponFusion;UNHOLY;;The unholy fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from an evil deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are evil-aligned. Damage from the weapon overcomes DR/evil and ignores the energy resistance of good dragons and good outsiders. The unholy fusion can’t be added to weapons that have the holy fusion.;cr-fusion-unholy;
CR;195;cr-fusion-venomous;WeaponFusion;VENOMOUS;;A weapon with the venomous fusion gains the injection weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an injection attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is exposed to the drug, medicinal, or poison when you use the injection property in an attack. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;cr-fusion-venomous;
CR;202;cr-vesk-monolith;Armor;Vesk Monolith;I–III;The ultimate battle gear, pioneered by the vesk, these suits of heavy armor have a dappled polycarbonate shell that resembles stone in texture. A monolith suit looks like a massive articulated golem formed of stone plates. Despite its size, monolith armor moves easily thanks to its power-assisted joints. Sigils and personal emblems can be “chiseled” on the breastplate or shoulder guards of a monolith suit to signal the wearer’s allegiance.;cr-vesk-monolith;
CR;202;cr-vesk-overplate;Armor;Vesk Overplate;I–V;These utilitarian suits of heavy armor reflect the brute strength of their inventors. Overplate makes no concession to comfort. Instead, each polycarbonate suit is solid, dense, and often unadorned, though the high-quality craftsmanship of each suit is apparent. Overplate has a reputation for withstanding any sort of trauma, thanks to its coating of thermoplastic resin.;cr-vesk-overplate;
CR;202;cr-vitrum-plate;Armor;Vitrum Plate;;Made of transparent polyethylene, vitrum plate resembles a suit of carved crystal. Though the material is hard as metal, it shimmers and refracts light like glass. The difficulty of compressing polyethylene to preserve its lightness while affording such protection makes this type of heavy armor expensive.;cr-vitrum-plate;
CR;202;cr-voidshield-armor;Armor;Voidshield Armor;;Constructed from interlocking carbon nanotubes, voidshield armor is a matte black and remarkably thin. Android armorsmiths were the first to develop this heavy armor, and most suits bear a mechanical, robotic design. Voidshield armor sets are suitable for many upgrades and are popular among experienced explorers.;cr-voidshield-armor;
CR;195;cr-fusion-vorpal;WeaponFusion;VORPAL;;With the vorpal fusion, a weapon can tear between the molecules of a creature. The weapon gains the severe wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the severe wound effect. Only a weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;cr-fusion-vorpal;
CR;186;cr-w-boson-crystal;Weapon;W-boson Crystal;Greater, Lesser, Minor, Standard, True;W-boson crystals amplify the sheer amount of damage a weapon deals.;cr-w-boson-crystal;
CR;195;cr-fusion-wounding;WeaponFusion;WOUNDING;;The wounding fusion causes a weapon to deal exceptionally traumatic damage. The weapon gains the wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the wound effect.;cr-fusion-wounding;
CR;186;cr-x-gen-gun;Weapon;X-Gen Gun;Advanced, Elite, Paragon, Tactical;X-gen guns are named for their external generator—a power pack that drives the automatic feed of the weapon. They are common on fortified bases and in large armed encampments.;cr-x-gen-gun;
CR;202;cr-ysoki-refractor-suit;Armor;Ysoki Refractor Suit;;The innovative ysoki created this reinforced jumpsuit layered with energy-reflective foil. This light armor is undeniably noticeable, but it also protects against energy attacks with the same efficacy as it does kinetic attacks. Ysoki refractor suits are popular among all races now and can be tinted in different metallic shades.;cr-ysoki-refractor-suit;
CR;183;cr-zero-cannon;Weapon;Zero Cannon;Advanced, Elite, Tactical;Zero cannons project a freezing line straight out from a generator, affecting any targets within the line. A pair of tanks in the cannon’s heavy stock contain chemical coolants that produce a violent endothermic reaction when mixed in the insulated barrel.;cr-zero-cannon;
CR;183;cr-zero-pistol;Weapon;Zero Pistol;Avalanche-Class, Blizzard-Class, Frostbite- Class, Hailstorm-Class;Zero pistols have a weighted grip to balance their unusually heavy barrels. A cylindrical canister over the barrel contains and directs the coolants.;cr-zero-pistol;
CR;183;cr-zero-rifle;Weapon;Zero Rifle;Avalanche-Class, Blizzard-Class, Frostbite- Class, Hailstorm-Class;Zero rifles have long, bulky barrels and tend to be very front- heavy. A heavy tank over the barrel stores the rifle’s coolant supply, contributing most of its bulk.;cr-zero-rifle;
AR;74;ar-absorptive-shell;PowArmor;Absorptive Shell;;"This powered armor consists of a thin frame around a central command unit (which fits around the torso for a typical wearer), covered in form-fitting plates filled with a rheopectic fluid that hardens when struck, dispersing force throughout the armor and absorbing crushing blows. Although an absorptive shell provides significant protection, the fluid-filled plates can’t support a weapon mount.
Unlike many forms of powered armor which are primarily used as military combat gear, absorptive shells are also often used as safety equipment for skilled rescue workers operating in extremely hazardous conditions, ranging from areas prone to rockfalls, starship crashes, and vehicles that still have explosives and industrial chemicals leaking from them, to actual war zones where rescue workers may come under fire.";ar-absorptive-shell;
AR;62;ar-fusion-accurate;WeaponFusion;ACCURATE;;The accurate fusion bestows exceptional balance and handling on a weapon. When you take a move action to aim a weapon with this fusion at a specific target, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll with that weapon provided neither you nor your target has moved since you aimed. You also gain this bonus if you take a move action to aim for other purposes, such as aiming a weapon with the sniper special property. Only ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-accurate;
AR;62;ar-fusion-advancing;WeaponFusion;ADVANCING;;When you defeat a foe, a weapon with the advancing fusion draws you further into the fray. The first time each round that you make a successful melee attack with an advancing weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you can take a guarded step as a reaction. This movement must move you closer to at least one foe.;ar-fusion-advancing;
AR;37;ar-agitator;Weapon;Agitator;;An agitator is a portable generator of microwave radiation that rapidly heats up targets to create internal bubbles of steam or makes targets burst into flames. The longer the weapon is focused, the more intense the agitation becomes, making it a favored by the defenders of bunkers, guard posts, and other emplacements. Ember agitators and blaze agitators rely on individual generators, taking the form of a bulky cylinder in the middle of the gun that hums ominously as the weapon fires, but miniaturization technology allows inferno agitators and solar flare agitators to include multiple smaller generators for increased effect.;ar-agitator;
AR;44;ar-anchor-pistol;Weapon;Anchor Pistol;;Blasts from this electromagnetic pistol create a magnetic field that hampers a foe’s movement. Barathus working on Liavara developed these weapons, as the magnetic fields ensnare a target without causing it to fall—a useful feature when confronting the operators of illicit harvesting endeavors on a gas giant. Many parts of an anchor pistol are grown from living organisms, resulting in a lightweight pistol that gleams like mother-of-pearl. Voltaic anchor pistols employ typical electromagnetism, while the emergent and inductive anchor pistols use higher symmetries to produce aperiodic force. The flux anchor pistol relies on quantum-phase factors to generate extraordinarily powerful blasts.;ar-anchor-pistol;
AR;41;ar-angel-wing;Weapon;Angel Wing;;"Though it appears as an extended sword hilt when still, the angel wing takes its name from the uncontained plasma that trails in an arc following the leading edge when the blade is swung. The weapon is favored by followers of Sarenrae, who take pride in mastering the sophisticated art of its use. Movanic angel wings have darker, almost shadowy blades; monadic angel wings have golden plasma trails; and the astral angel wing burns white hot.";ar-angel-wing;
AR;45;ar-arc-caster;Weapon;Arc Caster;;Flanked by large handles, an arc caster bristles with capacitors and antennae that release more energy than it can realistically control. While many shock weapons have a chance to arc to a second target on a hit, the arc caster is designed to achieve that feat on every shot, and particularly well-aimed strikes can sometimes arc twice. The storm and tempest models feature improvements that build upon the capabilities of static and aurora arc casters. Since there is little way to control which creatures are struck on the subsequent arcs, arc casters are generally used only by solo combatants or those with little regard for their allies’ well-being. More rarely, party members may take particular precautions against electricity damage, such as with a resistant armor spell or an electrostatic field armor upgrade, to protect themselves from an ally wielding an arc caster.;ar-arc-caster;
AR;55;ar-arrows;BattleWare;Arrows;;For those who want to deal greater damage with a bow but don’t want the noise and collateral damage of grenade arrows, conventional arrows are available with technological improvements to deal additional damage, including diamond-edge and molecular rift arrows. When used as ammunition for weapons other than the 1st-level bow (such as crossbolters), these arrows don’t increase damage, but diamond-edge arrows gain the wound critical hit effect and molecular rift arrows gain the severe wound critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the effect granted by the arrow.;ar-arrows;
AR;43;ar-assassin-rifle;Weapon;Assassin Rifle;;When assembled, an assassin rifle looks similar to a typical sniper rifle. Its modular construction, however, allows it to be broken down into small component parts that can be hidden on the user’s person—or even smuggled in a ysoki’s cheek pouches—making the weapon difficult to detect or identify. Assassin rifles are available in stalker, shadow, phantom, spectre, and wraith models.;ar-assassin-rifle;
AR;41;ar-aurora-cannon;Weapon;Aurora Cannon;;The aurora cannon is a variant plasma cannon with holding chambers that overcharge the plasma generated within the weapon. The walls of these chambers are typically translucent, allowing a veiled view of the shifting plasma. The aurora cannon’s modified plasma blasts cause creatures it hits to glow with a surprisingly beautiful aura, making it difficult for them to hide. Aurora cannons are categorized according to the primary composition of these auroras, from the hydrogen aurora cannon to the electron and proton models.;ar-aurora-cannon;
AR;52;ar-battle-ribbon;Weapon;Battle Ribbon;;"The battleflowers of Ning have been using battle ribbons in ritualized combat for millennia, their use dating back to long before the Gap. The weapon is a 10-foot-long ribbon and about
3 inches wide with sharpened edges, and is employed in rippling and flowing motions around the user. Battle ribbons are difficult to use without training, so most who take up the battle ribbon seek apprenticeship with the famous battleflowers of Ning to learn the elaborate performance art—though acquiring such a mentor is difficult, as they take students only rarely. Battle ribbon varieties start with modern materials used in a traditional blade, then proceed to the innovations of the micro- edge and zero-edge battle ribbons.
";ar-battle-ribbon;
AR;62;ar-fusion-beneficent;WeaponFusion;BENEFICENT;;When you score a critical hit against a significant enemy with a weapon that has the beneficent fusion, you gain one charge of beneficence. As long as you are wielding the same weapon, you can expend a charge of beneficence to cast either remove affliction or lesser remove condition as a spell-like ability, using the weapon’s item level as your caster level. You cannot have more than one charge of beneficence at a time, and you lose all charges of beneficence if you take a 10 minute rest and spend a Resolve Point to regain your Stamina Points or if you take an 8-hour rest and regain your daily-use abilities and spells. If the weapon with the beneficent fusion has an item level of 14 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast remove condition. If the weapon has an item level of 19 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast greater remove condition. A weapon cannot have the beneficent weapon fusion if it also has the unholy or wounding weapon fusions.;ar-fusion-beneficent;
AR;37;ar-blaze-rifle;Weapon;Blaze Rifle;;A blaze rifle is a bulky, ungainly weapon, with a rifle stock and two tanks of petrol mounted atop the barrel. Compared to other petrol weapons, the blaze rifle fires a far narrower stream of petrol, which allows for greater accuracy. Fire-loving mercenaries often choose the blaze rifle to avoid charring their allies. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenix- class blaze rifles are common throughout the Pact Worlds.;ar-blaze-rifle;
AR;49;ar-blindmark-rifle;Weapon;Blindmark Rifle;;Blindmark rifles generate sonic frequencies through carefully aligned resonance in multiple magnetic cylinders positioned between the stock and the short muzzle of the weapon. When the rifle’s shot hits a target, that target retains the resonance as a faint or subsonic tone useful for creatures that have blindsense (sound or vibration) or blindsight (sound or vibration). Multiple targets struck by the same blindmark rifle emit identical tones that can be distinguished only by location. Blindmark rifles are manufactured in thunderstrike, LFD (low-frequency device), HFD (high-frequency device), and banshee models.;ar-blindmark-rifle;
AR;62;ar-fusion-bombarding;WeaponFusion;BOMBARDING;;"The bombarding fusion allows a weapon to duplicate the effect of a single grenade that is loaded into an extradimensional space within the weapon. Loading a grenade into a weapon with the bombarding fusion takes a full round, as does removing a previously loaded grenade. A grenade loaded into a weapon with the bombarding fusion cannot have an item level greater than the weapon’s item level. The grenade cannot be detonated, sundered, or otherwise affected while it is within this extradimensional space, and if the weapon is destroyed or gains the broken condition, the grenade is permanently destroyed.
Once per day, a weapon with the bombarding fusion can launch a mystic version of the loaded grenade. This acts as throwing the grenade, and uses the same proficiency and range increment as throwing a grenade, but does not require a free hand. As long as you are wielding a weapon with the bombarding fusion and it has not yet used this ability, you can launch the grenade as a ranged attack. Once this ability has been used, the loaded grenade can be removed from the extradimensional space, but a new grenade cannot be loaded into it until 24 hours have passed.";ar-fusion-bombarding;
AR;34;ar-bone-pistol;Weapon;Bone Pistol;;Usually crafted from bone and gristle, these pistols are prized by the Corpse Fleet and members of the Urgathoan church, but they have also been found in reaches of the galaxy untouched by Eoxian influence. The energy blasts from a bone pistol are a special blend of cold and negative energy that passes harmlessly over the nonliving. Bone pistols are commonly categorized as grave-class, crypt-class, sepulcher-class, and vault-class.;ar-bone-pistol;
AR;34;ar-bone-scepter;Weapon;Bone Scepter;;These narrow clubs are often constructed of numerous intertwined bones—as one might expect from a weapon designed by Eoxians—infused with a silvery absolute-zero alloy that instantly draws the heat out of living creatures on contact. Chill bone scepters and void bone scepters have fine threads of the rare alloy, while rigor bone scepters and cadaver bone scepters shimmer with it.;ar-bone-scepter;
AR;49;ar-boomer-rifle;Weapon;Boomer Rifle;;The long, rippled barrel of a boomer rifle focuses the sound of several shells ignited simultaneously into a wave of sonic energy. These weapons arose on Akiton as a wayward Veskarian battalion beset a series of scrappy outposts. When lighter rifles failed to pierce the advanced vesk armor, residents used sonic weapons to overwhelm their foes. Tremor and rumbler boomer rifles use low and damaging sonic frequencies. Concussive and shock wave versions also produce a jolt that can knock a target prone.;ar-boomer-rifle;
AR;75;ar-brawler-frame;PowArmor;Brawler Frame;;Designed for brutal gladiatorial matches against other fighters in powered armor, a brawler frame consists of nanotech shock absorbers sandwiched between rigid metal plates. The default frame comes with blunt piston-powered fists designed to deal bludgeoning damage, but customized models with heavy blades or picks (dealing slashing or piercing damage, respectively) are not uncommon. Many owners paint their brawler frames with garish colors to be more distinctive in the arena.;ar-brawler-frame;
AR;43;ar-breaching-gun;Weapon;Breaching Gun;;A breaching gun uses scattergun shells as ammunition against a single target at short range, dealing an impressive amount of damage and even tearing through doors and other objects. These weapons are most commonly seen in the hands of space pirates who need to blast through plastic interior doors, though expert users can use these weapons to break through airlock doors. Breaching guns also saw widespread use on Absalom Station in the aftermath of the Gap, as security forces desperately tried to maintain control over the station’s fractured and panicked population, which often required blasting through barricades and sealed interior airlocks. Utility, snub, impact, vortex, and grapeshot breaching guns are widely available on various worlds.;ar-breaching-gun;
AR;37;ar-burner;Weapon;Burner;;Indistinguishable from a flamethrower to the lay observer, a burner uses petrol as fuel to produce a strong jet of flame. However, the subtly narrower nozzle and recoil-suppressing gyros allow a burner to fire streams of petrol with more control and focus than its traditional cousin. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenix-class burners are all widely available.;ar-burner;
AR;37;ar-burning-chains;Weapon;Burning Chains;;Hellknights of the Order of the Chain favor these lengths of blackened, fiery chain, which often incorporate etchings of infernal runes or hellscapes into their complex designs. Burning chains aren’t known for their damage so much as their extreme flexibility in confounding an enemy—and, of course, for the visual imagery a burning chain provides when combined with the distinctive Hellknight armor. The order’s names for the various models have become the most commonly used, from fiend-class burning chains to malebranche- and archdevil-class burning chains.;ar-burning-chains;
AR;45;ar-cathode-cannon;Weapon;Cathode Cannon;;Cathode cannons were originally designed by members of the Android Abolitionist Front, and many varieties made by different races nonetheless are decorated with circuit designs reminiscent of the weapons’ android inventors. The tactical cathode cannon is a standard-issue weapon for members of the Front, while advanced, elite, paragon, and shockstorm cathode cannons are often used by mercenaries and assault forces with a variety of goals.;ar-cathode-cannon;
AR;41;ar-cavitation-pistol;Weapon;Cavitation Pistol;;"A series of prongs takes the place of this pistol’s barrel; firing the weapon causes a small sphere of energy to form at their center and launch forward at speed. If the wielder times the shot perfectly, the plasma sphere pulses just as it hits the target, dealing damage to nearby creatures, but most find the feat difficult to replicate consistently. A vapor cavitation pistol creates a very focused sphere, while the inertial cavitation pistol creates one that implodes on impact. Hydrodynamic and thermodynamic cavitation pistols use more complex reactions that carry significantly more destructive power.";ar-cavitation-pistol;
AR;75;ar-celerity-rigging-(hybrid);PowArmor;Celerity Rigging (hybrid);;Unlike most other suits of powered armor, which are cumbersome and slow, this armor was designed for magically amplified responsiveness and speed. The armor resembles a humanoid frame of narrow rods, providing you with superior visibility and maneuverability while worn. Instead of heavy plating to absorb blows, celerity rigging uses sophisticated planes of magical force to deflect attacks. Incorporeal creatures’ attacks target your KAC rather than your EAC when you are wearing this armor.;ar-celerity-rigging-(hybrid);
AR;62;ar-fusion-charge-disrupting;WeaponFusion;CHARGE DISRUPTING;;A weapon with the charge disrupting fusion disrupts power sources. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the charge disrupting fusion, either the target or a single visible object carried by the target is subject to discharge, as the spell. The target creature (or its bearer, in the case of an object) can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect, as normal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the charge disrupting effect.;ar-fusion-charge-disrupting;
AR;45;ar-charge-emitter;Weapon;Charge Emitter;;This series of insulating reinforced-glass rings can be installed into armor upgrade slots and focuses an electrical charge into a targeted bolt. The sheer power necessary to project a bolt of electricity means that even an impulse charge emitter is a substantial weapon, and jolt charge emitters and surge charge emitters are significantly more powerful. Their relatively slim profile makes them popular for a number of users, from androids and others who benefit from a racial armor upgrade slot, to starship-repair crews in hostile space who want to keep their hands free for their work without leaving themselves totally undefended.;ar-charge-emitter;
AR;52;ar-chitinblade;Weapon;Chitinblade;;The serrated, sweeping blade of a chitinblade is based on technology recovered from encounters with the Swarm. The source material can come from a natural part of a creature’s body, but the final weapon is detached and wielded with two hands. A tactical chitinblade is modeled on an animal counterpart with little modification, but high-tech materials and manufacturing improve on nature in the microserrated, nanoserrated, and ultraserrated models.;ar-chitinblade;
AR;68;ar-clearweave;Armor;Clearweave;;"The formfitting fabric of clearweave light armor is completely transparent to better display the fashion choices beneath it. Discrete force field generators along each side resemble intricate tattoos as much as they resemble circuitry. Clearweave darkens automatically when exposed to harmful solar radiation or laser fire.
Clearweave II contains built-in microprojectors that allow the wearer to display glowing patterns, simple art, and even icons and logos through the armor’s fabric. These displays can be controlled via a personal comm unit or a more advanced computer. The glow emitted by the suit when displaying such patterns isn’t bright enough to provide useful illumination,
but it does reveal the wearer’s position in darkness or dim light.";ar-clearweave;
AR;52;ar-cluster-launcher;Weapon;Cluster Launcher;;The cluster launcher fires multiple grenades as a single shot, granting those grenades increased range and a larger blast radius. Each of the models—tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon—features an increase in range, capacity, and overall explosive power.;ar-cluster-launcher;
AR;43;ar-coil-rifle;Weapon;Coil Rifle;;A coil rifle is a long, slender firearm surrounded by a coil that generates carefully aligned magnetic fields that accelerate a single round with impressive power and accuracy. Precision coil rifles are the most affordable of these weapons, while specialist coil rifles have greater range and efficacy. Rangefinder, saboteur, and assassin coil rifles are especially deadly weapons that are appreciated by true connoisseurs, veteran mercenaries, and experienced firearm specialists.;ar-coil-rifle;
AR;45;ar-colossus-coil;Weapon;Colossus Coil;;Where massive creatures roam, those who fight against them for survival develop colossal weapons. Such is the case with the colossus coil, a weapon said to have been developed to hunt colossi on the planet Daimalko. It has since spread to many systems, including the Pact Worlds. This heavy firearm has a barrel sporting a series of toroidal high-voltage generators that collectively produce powerful arcs of electricity, and it can be overcharged to deliver even more destructive blasts. The electric blast sometimes overwhelms its target, branching off to hit another. The corona colossus coil produces a ring of electricity, while a brush colossus coil produces a more diffuse field. A streamer arc colossus coil produces a traditional arc of electricity, while the multistream colossus coil generates multiple such streams for a devastating blast.;ar-colossus-coil;
AR;75;ar-commander's-harness;PowArmor;Commander's Harness;;A reinforced version of the standard battle harness (Core Rulebook 204), this powered armor frame is most often used by squad leaders commanding units of heavily armored soldiers. Its larger size helps leaders of entire armored battalions maintain visibility and control during a confrontation.;ar-commander's-harness;
AR;40;ar-compliance-ray;Weapon;Compliance Ray;;"With a wider beam than typical lasers, the compliance ray is designed for crowd control and other nonmilitary uses. Although these rays are legal for civilians to own, most models are themed to fit in with the local constabulary’s armor; the Stewards’ blue-and-gold models are common throughout the Pact Worlds. Shots from these pistols cause intense discomfort, and a hit to the eyes can cause temporary blindness. Models begin with the flash designation and increase in intensity as follows: flare, strobe, starburst, and sunspot.";ar-compliance-ray;
AR;41;ar-conqueror;Weapon;Conqueror;;Conquerors are perhaps the largest and most difficult to handle of the plasma weapon category. A conquerer can deliver a single devastating blast of plasma, but the weapon is rather front-heavy and difficult to maneuver. Some vesk take up the weapon as a sign of their patron deity, Damoritosh, viewing it as the ranged spiritual equivalent of the doshko. In addition to the red star, yellow star, white star, and blue star models, the particularly powerful violet star conqueror has recently made its way onto the market.;ar-conqueror;
AR;62;ar-fusion-conserving;WeaponFusion;CONSERVING;;Weapons with the conserving fusion preserve their ammunition and charges after a miss. When you miss with a ranged attack roll, your charge or ammunition is not consumed, as though the weapon had never been fired. This fusion does not prevent your weapon from malfunctioning or breaking as a consequence of your attack. Only weapons that use arrows, batteries, darts, flares, grenade arrows, mini-rockets, rounds, or scattergun shells as ammunition can benefit from a conserving fusion.;ar-fusion-conserving;
AR;63;ar-fusion-continuous;WeaponFusion;CONTINUOUS;;The continuous fusion lets a weapon with the line special property sustain fire continuously by expending additional charges. When you make a line attack with a weapon with this fusion, you can expend additional ammunition or charges equal to the weapon’s usage value to sustain your attack until the start of your next turn. This has no additional effect on targets already within the line, but anything that moves across your weapon’s line is attacked using your original attack roll and damage. If you hit but fail to damage this new target, it blocks your line as normal. If an existing blockage is removed, your line extends out to its maximum range unless blocked anew, and it can damage creatures and objects that it failed to reach previously. You can’t damage a single target more than once in a round with the continuous fusion, even if it moves in and out of the path of your attack. If you move from where you initiated the attack for any reason, your line automatically ends. Only weapons that can make a line attack benefit from this fusion. You can use the continuous fusion with unwieldy weapons.;ar-fusion-continuous;
AR;40;ar-convergent-laser;Weapon;Convergent Laser;;"For those seeking efficient laser attacks in a reliable, relatively lightweight format, the convergent laser is an ideal weapon. The weapon’s smaller lasers synchronize and focus their output on a single target to deal more damage than any single beam could deal alone; however, the need to carefully aim and adjust the weapon makes it somewhat slower to fire than its single-beam counterparts. Typically, the different beams originate from the corners of a square or triangular barrel, angling in to join at a single point on the target. A single-wave convergent laser emits a single wavelength, with all its beams sharing a color. Multiwave convergent lasers produce different wavelengths for each beam, using computer assistance to continually adjust the output, while a wide-spectrum convergent laser increases the number of beams until their joining point on the target is a white so brilliant that it’s painful to look at.";ar-convergent-laser;
AR;34;ar-coolant-sprayer;Weapon;Coolant Sprayer;;Coolant sprayers were designed following the principles of a flamethrower, but with an eye more toward hindrance than sheer damage. Experts can easily identify a coolant sprayer by the bulky insulation surrounding the sprayer’s coolant reservoir. The weapon expels a cone of activated coolant that stiffens and freezes living tissue. While not harmless, the effect is somewhat less deadly than most energy weapons. Hiemal, algid, glacial, and isothermal coolant sprayers all function in similar ways, though their destructive potential varies from one model to another.;ar-coolant-sprayer;
AR;41;ar-core-hammer;Weapon;Core Hammer;;The hollow head of this two-handed hammer is filled with exceptionally dense plasma, which is released on contact with enemies, sometimes even spraying plasma on a well- placed strike. Core hammers constructed by the followers of Angradd tend to be functional works of dark metal, where vesk models are usually designed to display the plasma behind magnetic containment. Tactical core hammers and advanced core hammers contain a stable plasma core, while fusion core hammers and reactor core hammers employ devices that focus plasma to trigger momentary flares of nuclear fusion.;ar-core-hammer;
AR;63;ar-fusion-cruel;WeaponFusion;CRUEL;;The cruel fusion feeds on fear and despair. When you strike a target that is frightened, panicked, or shaken with a weapon with this fusion, the target is sickened for 1 round. When you make a successful attack that drops a foe (either by killing it or knocking it unconscious), you gain 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes. Weapons with the nonlethal special property cannot benefit from the cruel fusion.;ar-fusion-cruel;
AR;34;ar-cryospike;Weapon;Cryospike;;Cryospikes began as fire-extinguishing equipment, but they have since been weaponized and now serve a variety of roles. The weapon discharges a spike of hyper-cooled fluid that can be configured to put out a small fire or deal a burst of cold damage to its target. Most cryospike users integrate the apparatus’s maze of polymer tubing and coolant reservoirs into their armor to keep it always close at hand. The personal cryospike is based on a model originally designed for use in powered armor prototypes (as such early designs are prone to fires caused by engineering faults). Residential cryospikes are typically employed by firefighting crews, while industrial cryospikes is most often kept on hand in massive starship- engineering bays.;ar-cryospike;
AR;43;ar-dart-cannon;Weapon;Dart Cannon;;When Akiton’s economy began to collapse in the wake of the thasteron bust, scrappy frontier townspeople were left to cobble together their necessities from whatever they had on hand and defend what resources they had from outside raiders. Dart cannons were created by these inventive souls, who reconfigured their depreciated mining equipment and less critical medical supplies into a weapon to stave off looters and thieves. These wide-barreled cannons fire a barrage of magnetically accelerated darts that contain barbed cores rather than toxins or medicinals. While this prevents the darts from being used to inject substances, the barbs can lodge in a target’s body, dealing lasting damage. Dart cannons tend to see use in environments with some level of gravity, as no one wants to deal with the aftermath of a dart cannon’s discharge in a zero-g environment. This weapon is available in light, tactical, heavy, advanced, elite, and paragon models.;ar-dart-cannon;
AR;40;ar-dazzler;Weapon;Dazzler;;Dazzlers are a form of crowd control used primarily for civil peacekeeping. While the weapons use lasers to damage and sometimes blind targets, the beams are carefully calibrated to avoid inflicting lethal injury. Built on similar principles to the smaller compliance ray, dazzlers also tend to bear the colors of local law-enforcement groups. However, the similarities end there, as the dazzler is a bulky device usually carried with the help of a shoulder strap, with its business end covered by dozens of glassy bulbs surrounded by a conical shield. Downplaying this somewhat disturbing appearance, dazzler manufacturer ATech holds up the weapons as an important tool for safe peacekeeping and spreads the weapons wherever AbadarCorp is found. Dazzlers come in flash, strobe, and sunspot models.;ar-dazzler;
AR;36;ar-decoupler;Weapon;Decoupler;;"Some manufacturers have streamlined the disintegrator pistol’s design to create a more affordable option; the result of their efforts is referred to simply as a decoupler. A decoupler is smaller and lighter than a disintegrator pistol, trading some of its outright destructive power for the ability to deal superficial pain that can leave targets shaking in their boots. In the Apostaean city of Nightarch, the ruling House Zeizerer issues decouplers to its enforcers, many of whom refer to the weapons as “facilitators.” Manufacturers typically produce bruiser, pusher, and screamer decouplers.";ar-decoupler;
AR;63;ar-fusion-defending;WeaponFusion;DEFENDING;;"Weapons with the defending fusion aid their wielder when blocking or fighting defensively. When you fight defensively while attacking with a weapon with this fusion, you gain a
+1 bonus to attack rolls with the weapon (effectively reducing the penalty from fighting defensively to –3) and an additional
+1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Additionally, if your weapon has the block weapon special property, increase the enhancement bonus to your AC against melee attacks from that target to +2. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.
";ar-fusion-defending;
AR;68;ar-dendron-armor;Armor;Dendron Armor;;"A living defense designed by the Xenowardens, dendron armor  melds bioengineered wood with advanced microbe- spun polymers. A mossy layer beneath this outer shell provides cushioning and life support. Xenowardens stylize this heavy armor to resemble the sentient trees found on Castrovel and other verdant worlds. The organic design of dendron armor makes adding upgrades a challenge, but it offers a good balance between mobility and protection.
Each model of dendron armor has features based on a species of tree believed to have been native to lost Golarion. The least is the humble ash, followed by the supple yew, the hardy oak, and finally the majestic sequoia.";ar-dendron-armor;
AR;49;ar-dirge-cannon;Weapon;Dirge Cannon;;Pirates are the most common users of dirge cannons. The potbellied, shoulder-resting weapons cause a brief but intense sound burst at frequencies and pressure sufficient to rupture living cells while leaving inorganic objects unharmed. The result is a weapon that can eliminate a starship’s crew without causing any damage to the vessel or its cargo. Those who prefer lighter damage favor harmonic and resonant cannons, leaving anharmonic and parametric models for situations that call for carnage.;ar-dirge-cannon;
AR;50;ar-dirge-pistol;Weapon;Dirge Pistol;;The oscillating sonic waves discharged from a dirge pistol work like those fired from a dirge cannon. Raiders and hijackers prize these weapons for their effect against living targets, which can leave many valuables unharmed. Harmonic and resonant dirge pistols generate stable oscillations, while the anharmonic, parametric, and radial dirge pistols have concentric generator cylinders to produce dissonant and more harmful output.;ar-dirge-pistol;
AR;36;ar-disintegration-lash;Weapon;Disintegration Lash;;A disintegration lash is a marvel of bioengineering—a technological living organism that feeds on matter by breaking it down with its own high-energy proton-decoupling field. The result is a black, snakelike lash crackling with red-tinged energy, making this a weapon commonly wielded by those looking to intimidate their foes. Disintegration lashes are designated in the standard method for disintegrator weapons: liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator.;ar-disintegration-lash;
AR;36;ar-disintegrator-cannon;Weapon;Disintegrator Cannon;;This wide-barreled cannon emits a stream of red-tinged energy that originates from the weapon’s heavy proton tank, affecting all enemies in a line. Like most disintegrator weapons, they are available in liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator models.;ar-disintegrator-cannon;
AR;36;ar-disintegrator-pistol;Weapon;Disintegrator Pistol;;This hefty pistol has two small internal tanks that generate the energy needed to deliquesce the wielder’s targets. Disintegrator pistols come in liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator models.;ar-disintegrator-pistol;
AR;36;ar-disintegrator-rifle;Weapon;Disintegrator Rifle;;Rather snub nosed compared to other longarms, a disintegrator rifle is heavier than it looks due to the row of round energy- generating compartments atop its frame. These compartments generate enough energy for the weapon to liquefy enemies’ bodies. Well-connected customers can purchase liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator disintegrator rifles.;ar-disintegrator-rifle;
AR;40;ar-divergent-laser;Weapon;Divergent Laser;;"Originally developed alongside convergent lasers, divergent
lasers use multiple laser beams emitting from a blocky casing to produce a cone-shaped output. This weapon’s damage is significantly less than that achieved
by the convergent lasers, but the same systems that synchronize wavelengths in a convergent laser allow the divergent laser to focus on multiple targets. The single-color beam of a single-wave divergent laser sets it apart from the shimmering colors of a multiwave divergent laser. A wide-spectrum divergent laser has a nearly white beam and could be mistaken for a spotlight at a glance—though not by a target struck by one!
";ar-divergent-laser;
AR;37;ar-dragon-pistol;Weapon;Dragon Pistol;;A dragon pistol features a wide muzzle that is often shaped like a dragon’s maw. The weapon discharges discrete orbs of flaming petrol that can cling to targets. A wyrmling dragon pistol casts small petrol globules, while drake and wyvern dragon pistols have increased outputs. The true dragon pistol is as devastating as it is rare.;ar-dragon-pistol;
AR;37;ar-dragon-rifle;Weapon;Dragon Rifle;;A larger and more powerful version of a dragon pistol, a dragon rifle also commonly bears draconic motifs or iconography in its aesthetic design. The globules of petrol from a dragon rifle are slightly larger than those from a pistol, and the weapon can be set to launch a series of shots in quick succession. Wyrmling, drake, and wyvern dragon rifles are available, along with the powerful and rare true dragon rifle.;ar-dragon-rifle;
AR;36;ar-dross-gun;Weapon;Dross Gun;;Early models of disintegrator weapons were designed solely to deal indiscriminate corrosion damage to targets. The dross gun is a slightly more refined version, though it lacks the overall power those initial prototypes had. Its shots are slightly more concentrated, dealing substantial damage to objects and dealing painful, lasting wounds to a target on a direct hit. A scrapper dross gun is the smallest model available, used as often to remove choice parts from a wrecked starship as it is to remove crew from the ship in the first place, and the scoring and flux models have increased wounding capabilities.;ar-dross-gun;
AR;54;ar-dynamo-shuriken;Weapon;Dynamo Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. Using the best in miniaturized machine and electronic technology, a dynamo shuriken can use the power it generates when thrown to deliver an electric pulse to a target or to return to its thrower.;ar-dynamo-shuriken;
AR;45;ar-electroflail;Weapon;Electroflail;;"An electroflail is a 2-foot-long haft and a floating spiked or ridged ball; as there is no visible tether between the two components, an electroflail appears to be two separate weapons. An electromagnetic force causes the ball to stay within a predetermined range of the haft’s end—usually around 1 foot away—while also conducting a substantial electric charge to the ball that is discharged upon a strike. The magnetic field can also interfere with other weapons, allowing a proficient user to use an electroflail to knock opponents’ weapons out of their grasp. These weapons see frequent use among various Hellknight orders, which often custom order designs featuring grinning devils, complete with spiked wings. Electroflails are available in tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models.";ar-electroflail;
AR;49;ar-electron-crystal;Weapon;Electron Crystal;;While in use, an electron crystal causes a solar weapon to crackle with electricity and dance with magnetic distortions. The user can control these distortions to dull a blow to the target, which many solarians consider to be a useful feature for incapacitating foes. An electron crystal polarizes the energy of a solar weapon, adding electricity damage and allowing you to convert all damage dealt to nonlethal. These crystals are available in shard, least, minor, lesser, standard, greater, and true versions.;ar-electron-crystal;
AR;63;ar-fusion-energetic;WeaponFusion;ENERGETIC;;A projectile weapon with the energetic fusion relies on energy rather than physical ammunition to generate kinetic attacks. Instead of being loaded with darts, rounds, or scattergun shells, the weapon is loaded with a battery. The type of battery the projectile weapon uses depends on its original capacity as follows: 1–20 use batteries, 21–40 use high-capacity batteries, 41–80 use super-capacity batteries, and 81 or more use ultra- capacity batteries. The weapon’s usage does not change, but it takes charges from the installed battery, rather than expending physical ammunition. The fusion converts the energy into physical bullets which target KAC and deal damage normally for the weapon. Only weapons in the projectile category that would normally use darts, rounds, or scattergun shells can benefit from the energetic fusion.;ar-fusion-energetic;
AR;34;ar-energy-converter;Weapon;Energy Converter;;"Boxy devices covered with various gauges and protruding antennae, energy converters resemble dangerously experimental pieces of hardware. These devices invert matter-antimatter annihilation; instead of generating massive amounts of heat from a tiny speck of matter, an energy converter generates a tiny speck of matter by drawing an incredible amount of heat energy from a nearby area. Tactical, advanced, and elite energy converters each create relatively larger flecks of matter, drawing their energy from a larger area in order to do so.";ar-energy-converter;
AR;68;ar-enforcer-armor;Armor;Enforcer Armor;;"The faceless, slate-gray design of enforcer armor blends intimidation and anonymity. This heavy armor’s design echoes the aegis series’ personal tank approach, albeit with markedly inferior protection. Enforcer armor often towers a full foot over the wearer’s natural height, with most of the wearer’s head safely sheltered behind the breastplate and sensory input handled through projected video and audio feeds. Criminal organizations use enforcer armor to keep their hired muscle
impersonal and enigmatic.
It is difficult to distinguish different models of enforcer armor visually, so as not to betray the armor’s capabilities outside of battle. However, the lack of distinguishing features often makes enforcer armor seem like a blank canvas to warriors who cover their individual suits in unit markings, personal slogans, illustrations of mascots, and even graffiti.
";ar-enforcer-armor;
AR;63;ar-fusion-ensnaring;WeaponFusion;ENSNARING;;The ensnaring fusion binds the target on a critical hit. On a critical hit with this weapon, you can apply the entangle weapon special property (Core Rulebook 181). The entangle effect ends after 1 minute if the target has not already escaped it. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the entangle effect. If you successfully affect a target with both the entangling and ensnaring fusions on the same attack roll, only the ensnaring fusion applies, and your use of the entangling fusion is not consumed. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-ensnaring;
AR;40;ar-excavation-laser;Weapon;Excavation Laser;;This sturdy, snub-nosed laser rifle resembles a starship’s mining laser in miniature. It fires a powerful beam that loses intensity after a relatively short distance, which makes it not only useful in many mining and quarrying endeavors but also effective in medium-range combat for those trained in its use. Most technologically advanced civilizations develop excavation lasers, and the tools are commonly seen in the hands of workers from the Ulrikka Clanholdings and other miners in the Diaspora. Light, medium, and heavy excavation lasers all see extensive use.;ar-excavation-laser;
AR;75;ar-explorer's-cradle;PowArmor;Explorer's Cradle;;"Travelers on alien worlds must be prepared to confront a variety of difficult environments. This long-range powered armor resembles a humanoid torso atop several bristly metal tendrils ending in sharp, grasping claws. The armor has comfortable seating and a supply of nutritious paste delivered intravenously; while wearing an explorer’s cradle, you do not need to eat or drink. As a standard action, you can extend and reshape the tentacles into a variety of forms resembling limbs, fins, or wings, gaining one of the following abilities until you next rearrange the tentacles.
Bladed Strikes: The damage dealt by this armor increases to 4d8 slashing damage.
Climbing Claws: You gain a climb speed of 20 feet.
Creeping Legs: Your movement is not slowed by difficult terrain, although you still cannot run or charge through difficult terrain. Fluttering Wings: The tentacles splay out behind you and form connective membranes to create wings, granting you a fly
speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability.
Undulating Tendrils: You gain a swim speed of 20 feet.";ar-explorer's-cradle;
AR;55;ar-explosive;BattleWare;Explosive;;Explosive ammo is used with projectile weapons and is available for most projectile weapons and other weapons that fire arrows and darts, as noted on Table 1–8. A weapon firing explosive ammo deals its normal amount of damage, but half of this damage is fire damage and grants the weapon the knockdown critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, the knockdown critical hit effect is added and considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect. If the weapon normally already has the knockdown critical hit effect, it instead gains the push (5 feet) critical hit effect in addition to knockdown, and this considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect.;ar-explosive;
AR;75;ar-extradimensional-armor-(hybrid);PowArmor;Extradimensional Armor (hybrid);;"Constructed with the aid of mad cultists who revere inhuman, unknowable entities from the most distant corners of reality, this metallic armor defies conventional geometry. Its flat planes appear strangely curved upon close inspection, and its contours bend and blur. Your opponents can’t keep a clear sight on the armor’s shape or position, even when looking directly at it. If you have concealment from an attacker from any source, increase the miss chance from concealment by 10% (normally to 30%). If you do not have concealment from an attacker, the armor’s warped shape grants you concealment but with only a 10% miss chance. This armor has no effect on attacks against you when you have total concealment. Wearing the armor has a deleterious effect on mortal sanity; when you remove the armor, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 plus 1 per full hour spent wearing the extradimensional armor) or take a –2 penalty to Will saves and Wisdom-based ability checks and skill checks for 24 hours.";ar-extradimensional-armor-(hybrid);
AR;37;ar-flame-launcher;Weapon;Flame Launcher;;Flame launchers sling large globules of aerated petrol with carefully timed ignition. The resulting explosion is usually well contained and can be placed with surprising precision. Although fed by the same sort of petrol tank found in burners and flamethrowers, the weapon is a complicated mess of air tanks, exposed circuitry, and tubing, all required to achieve the perfect mixture for controlled explosions. Fireball flame launchers are the weakest version of this weapon, outpowered by immolation flame launchers and the exceptionally powerful supernova flame launchers.;ar-flame-launcher;
AR;37;ar-flame-pistol;Weapon;Flame Pistol;;Inventive manufacturers have developed more effective versions of the classic flame pistol, resulting in the blaze, inferno, and solar flare models. Like other flame pistols, the more advanced models fire lines of ignited petrol from their barrels, but they work at higher pressure and include nanotechnology that breaks down the petrol into more volatile compounds as the weapon is fired.;ar-flame-pistol;
AR;37;ar-flame-spinner;Weapon;Flame Spinner;;"A flame spinner consists of two weighted balls attached to a length of cable; the pair is spun in an elegant, showy dance of spinning fire. Fireball and immolation flame spinners use petrol to generate a flaming nimbus around the ball’s metal casing, while supernova and fission flame spinners dispense with the casing and instead compress the petrol to generate a dense mass of blazing heat in place of each ball. Using a flame spinner effectively is difficult due to the complex handling required, and kasathas and other races with additional limbs find they have a substantial advantage in that regard.";ar-flame-spinner;
AR;42;ar-flare-axe;Weapon;Flare Axe;;A flare axe pushes a magnetically contained wave of plasma in a semicircular arc parallel to the haft that resembles a miniature solar flare. The color of plasma indicates the relative temperature (and therefore damage output) of each weapon: red star flare axes are the standard model, yellow star and white star flare axes are more dangerous, and blue star flare axes inflict the most destruction.;ar-flare-axe;
AR;37;ar-flare-rifle;Weapon;Flare Rifle;;A flare rifle is similar in appearance to a combat rifle, though it has a slightly wider barrel and magazine. This weapon fires flares, which don’t typically deal tremendous damage but can distract opponents. Dazzler flare rifles fire a single, relatively ordinary flare, while the vivifier flare rifle breaks open the flare and burns it all in moments, causing far greater light and heat. Coruscator, scorcher, and nova models fire more flares at a time to increase their damage output.;ar-flare-rifle;
AR;54;ar-flash-shuriken;Weapon;Flash Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. The friction of passing air and target impact activates a thrown flash shuriken so that the weapon delivers burn injuries and a potentially blinding flare.;ar-flash-shuriken;
AR;39;ar-foam-grenade;BattleWare;Foam Grenade;;"A foam grenade explodes on impact to release a burst of fire-suppressant foam akin to that from a fire extinguisher. This foam reduces the damage from the burning condition or from the corrode critical hit effect taken by creatures within the area by the listed amount each round; this ends the burning condition or corrode effect if it reduces the amount of damage to 0. This also ends any active fires within the affected area.";ar-foam-grenade;
AR;40;ar-focus-rifle;Weapon;Focus Rifle;;This elongated laser rifle contains additional lenses that further focus its output, creating a powerful beam that can punch through many substances at ranges far greater than those of a typical laser rifle. Dual, triple, and quad focus rifles use increasing numbers of focusing lenses, intensifying the laser but compounding the price. A compound focus rifle’s lenses are specially made of a rare form of glass, creating the most powerful output currently possible for such weapons.;ar-focus-rifle;
AR;42;ar-forked-pistol;Weapon;Forked Pistol;;Plasma builds up and arcs between the two long, notched tines of this pistol, amplifying in power as the stream travels the length of the weapon. Forked pistols are named for the number of notches in their plasma-generating forks, as each notch contributes to a more powerful blast. Pistols are typically available in 6-notch, 8-notch, 9-notch, and 10-notch models.;ar-forked-pistol;
AR;34;ar-freeze-ray;Weapon;Freeze Ray;;Across the galaxy, practically every sufficiently advanced civilization has created its own variation of the freeze ray. All freeze rays function in a similar way, emitting a long line of supercooled gas, but individual models reflect their species’ design aesthetics. In the Pact Worlds, the most common models reflect the slim profile of Vercite technology or the bony protrusions of Eoxian design. Hiemal, algid, and glacial freeze rays simply produce an extreme reduction in the temperature along the weapon’s line of effect. Isothermal freeze rays cause a persistent temperature drop, dealing further damage, while hypothermic freeze rays causes multiple temperature reductions in rapid succession for further increased destruction.;ar-freeze-ray;
AR;34;ar-frost-maul;Weapon;Frost Maul;;A two-handed hammer with a reservoir of coolant in its head, a frost maul simultaneously bludgeons and chills its target. As most substances become brittle and prone to shattering when subjected to extremely low temperatures, the frost maul excels at damaging objects it hits. Frost mauls come in aufeis, iceberg, floe, and glacier models.;ar-frost-maul;
AR;34;ar-frost-projector;Weapon;Frost Projector;;"A frost projector requires two armor upgrade slots to install: one for the short, wide barrel and another for the coolant canister and battery; cables and hoses connect the two components. These weapons are produced in frostbite-class, hailstorm-class, and blizzard-class models.";ar-frost-projector;
AR;34;ar-gale-baton;Weapon;Gale Baton;;A vortex of supercooled air swirls around this slender baton, freezing targets before the baton even makes contact and knocking dangerous projectiles off course. The tempest gale baton is the most common model and is widely available on the Idari and in other kasathan communities, with later developments resulting in the more powerful cyclone and hurricane gale batons.;ar-gale-baton;
AR;38;ar-gamma-rifle;Weapon;Gamma Rifle;;Gamma rifles direct concentrated bursts of gamma radiation that are strong enough to overcome normal environmental protections, burning targets from a distance, though users of such weapons risk exposure to that very radiation. Many find that the destructive effects of the ray are sufficient to outweigh the risk, and targets can even be subject to radiation sickness when struck in a vital organ. Terrestrial gamma rifles and ionizing gamma rifles feed energy through a mass of radioactive material in the muzzle to produce their deadly effects. Fusion and synchrotron gamma rifles instead produce radiation in a torus near the rifle’s stock, making them far more powerful, though still dangerous to the user.;ar-gamma-rifle;
AR;52;ar-garrote;Weapon;Garrote;;A pair of slim handles connected by flexible cable made of a strong alloy, the garrote is a weapon strongly associated with assassination. That’s no accident, as the weapon’s primary use is to silently strangle creatures. However, a garrote can also be used to ensnare appendages. The wire garrote is the simplest version, while the nanofiber, microfilament, and monowire models use increasingly fine cables to deal substantially more damage. For instance, the monowire version has a cable as thin as a single complex molecule, which closes into the handles when the weapon isn’t in use. This construction results in a nearly invisible cable with an extreme edge.;ar-garrote;
AR;45;ar-glass-blade;Weapon;Glass Blade;;"This combat knife is made almost entirely from potassium- treated aluminosilicate glass, a strong, transparent material that retains the insulating properties of glass. A single exposed wire along the leading edge carries a deadly electric charge; the glass of the blade insulates the wearer against electrocution, and a rubberized grip makes it easy to hold. Live glass blades carry a continuous current, while the jolt, impulse, and surge models discharge upon impact.";ar-glass-blade;
AR;49;ar-gluon-crystal;Weapon;Gluon Crystal;;A gluon crystal creates an entropic field around a weapon that inflicts traumatic wounds. The shard gluon crystal is presented here, while other models can be found on page 180 of the Core Rulebook.;ar-gluon-crystal;
AR;68;ar-grave-mantle;Armor;Grave Mantle;;"The utilitarian grave mantle is common both on Eox and among the Eoxian expatriates of the Corpse Fleet. The base model worn by rank- and-file troops consists of a tabard of ballistic fabric worn over plastic mesh, with additional layers of fabric reinforcing the joints. More expensive models enhance the mesh with nanowire and place ceramic plates beneath the
tabard. Despite Eoxian armies having no need for air, grave mantles retain life support systems as a defense against corrosive atmospheres and related hazards.
Grave mantle models include the base enlisted version, specialist models customized for the duties of their wearers, and officer models that combine superior protection with purely aesthetic additions such as holographic rank insignias.
";ar-grave-mantle;
AR;52;ar-graviton-pistol;Weapon;Graviton Pistol;;Many security forces and peacekeepers employ graviton pistols, since these weapons deal no damage but instead push or pull a target. Long rods running in parallel lines form a barrel-like structure that makes such a pistol easy to identify. The available models of graviton pistols start at linear, with vector, tensor, and chiral models are able to move a target increasing distances.;ar-graviton-pistol;
AR;52;ar-greataxe;Weapon;Greataxe;;No one can argue against the damage potential of a greataxe. Half-orcs who take an interest in fragmentary records from lost Golarion embrace the greataxe as a cultural symbol. Tactical greataxes are the most common, but sintered models are made of dense ceramic and designed to increase the axe’s effectiveness against modern gear. It’s hard to tell ultrathin greataxes from molecular rift models at a glance, but one’s edge is merely blurry while the other’s is actually translucent.;ar-greataxe;
AR;54;ar-grooved-shuriken;Weapon;Grooved Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. Fine channels crisscross the surface of a grooved shuriken. When an injectable substance is applied to the shuriken, it gathers in these channels and surface tension holds it in place. The grooves allow injection delivery without a specialized mechanism. Each shuriken holds a single dose of a drug, poison, or medicinal.;ar-grooved-shuriken;
AR;63;ar-fusion-guarded;WeaponFusion;GUARDED;;The guarded fusion guides timing so that ranged attacks don’t leave the wielder vulnerable. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon with this fusion, your attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The guarded fusion does not prevent attacks of opportunity provoked for any reason other than making a ranged attack. Only ranged and thrown weapons can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-guarded;
AR;38;ar-gulchgun;Weapon;Gulchgun;;"Gulchguns are a feat of fearless ysoki tinkering; the rifles use scattergun shells as ammunition but detonate them entirely within the rifle’s internal chambers, instead firing a tongue of flame, accompanied by tremendous noise. The technology of the gulchgun eventually developed into the shorter and more stable shellgun, but ysoki purists and desperate buyers alike keep the market for these weapons alive.";ar-gulchgun;
AR;34;ar-hail-pistol;Weapon;Hail Pistol;;A hail pistol includes a chamber behind the barrel that circulates supercooled vapor and causes it to coalesce into razor-edged shards of ice that leave foes with rime-edged bleeding wounds. Subzero, gelid, ultracold, and absolute-zero hail pistols each produce progressively larger and more jagged shards.;ar-hail-pistol;
AR;35;ar-hailcannon;Weapon;Hailcannon;;"Hailcannons use a complex integrated coolant system to generate staggering barrages of ice. Unlike with many cryo weapons, the hailcannon’s prolific output and
massive barrel allow the weapon to be fired in automatic mode, which can overwhelm targets. Subzero hailcannons are the standard model, and the increasing damage capacity of gelid, ultracold,
absolute-zero, and clathrate hailcannons proves attractive to many who swear by such weapons.
";ar-hailcannon;
AR;52;ar-handaxe;Weapon;Handaxe;;A balanced, wedge-shaped blade affixed to a lightweight haft, a handaxe can be wielded in melee or thrown. The flexibility of handaxes makes them a favorite of explorers of all types, and the basic handaxe is a common tool that can be used as a weapon. A tactical handaxe is made of a stronger, lightweight alloy, while the sintered handaxe uses a denser ceramic material for added heft and a much keener edge. An ultrathin handaxe has a blade so thin it can’t be seen clearly, while the molecular rift handaxe has a blade narrow enough to slice between molecules. Most handaxes have blade covers to prevent accidental injury to the wielder.;ar-handaxe;
AR;44;ar-handcannon;Weapon;Handcannon;;Handcannons are popular with those who want to impress or intimidate their foes through the sheer presence of their armament without having to invest in the training required to master longarms or heavy weaponry. Its oversized barrel and muzzle are somewhat precariously balanced on a one-handed grip, though most wielders use both hands to make the weapon more manageable in combat situations. The various model names of this weapon—bravado, swagger, bombast, braggadocio, and gasconade—were originally facetious references to the character of those who tend to favor them, though many users embrace the names unironically.;ar-handcannon;
AR;45;ar-handcoil;Weapon;Handcoil;;An ultraminiaturized version of the coilguns used on starships, this weapon has a short range but a powerful effect. Some of the first versions were produced by starship manufacturers and were accompanied by a promotional campaign suggesting that a starship’s crew should match the starship itself, complete with flight suits to match a given ship’s paint job. Most manufacturers still use the model classification set forth in those early campaigns: explorer, fighter, pilot, and capital handcoils.;ar-handcoil;
AR;39;ar-holy-water-grenade;BattleWare;Holy Water Grenade;;Produced by priests of good-aligned deities, holy water grenades explode with a spray of consecrated water that harms undead creatures and evil outsiders while leaving other creatures and objects merely damp. This typically isn’t enough water to damage computers or other electronic or technological items.;ar-holy-water-grenade;
AR;52;ar-hook-knife;Weapon;Hook Knife;;Slightly longer than a survival knife, a hook knife features a wicked barb along the blade’s back edge and deals vicious wounds to enemies when wielded effectively. The drow invented the hook knife, but the weapon is a favorite among cruel mercenaries and other unsavory types.;ar-hook-knife;
AR;52;ar-hook-sword;Weapon;Hook Sword;;A larger cousin of the hook knife, the hook sword is a longsword with a pronounced hook at one edge of the blade’s tip. This barb not only deals gouging wounds, but it can also be used to trip an unwary foe. The drow invented the hook sword based on their design for the hook knife, but the weapon can be found all over the galaxy in the hands of brutal fighters.;ar-hook-sword;
AR;42;ar-hydra-cannon;Weapon;Hydra Cannon;;Rather than firing a single burst of plasma, a hydra cannon generates countless discrete plasma filaments that spread outward in a pattern reminiscent of crawling serpents. The spread of these filaments can be somewhat controlled, allowing a proficient user to avoid hitting a limited number of creatures within the weapon’s area of effect. Python-series hydra cannons offer the least control, while viper-series, asp-series, and cobra- series hydra cannons offer increasingly fine-tuned control over their target areas.;ar-hydra-cannon;
AR;35;ar-ice-carbine;Weapon;Ice Carbine;;Rather than relying on coolant to produce supercooled gas, an ice carbine pumps heat out of large vents integrated in the weapon’s stock and uses the temperature change to produce brittle, razor-sharp shards of ice in the chamber. This design allows it to either fire a short, targeted shot or spray a hailstorm of piercing needles at a group of foes. The heat- exchange technology used in these weapons is common on Verces, where it’s used for many purposes, making it relatively easy to find them in the Pact Worlds, from the subzero models (often built in illicit basement labs) to absolute-zero ice carbines, which are the best in the Pact Worlds. Gelid and ultracold ice carbines improve on the subzero version’s technology and overall power.;ar-ice-carbine;
AR;35;ar-ice-launcher;Weapon;Ice Launcher;;A decidedly unsubtle weapon, an ice launcher fires a huge block of ice at an opponent. The weapon is heavy and slow to fire, but the weight of the supercooled ice can knock an opponent to the ground and deal extensive cold damage. Aufeis and iceberg launchers produce small enough quantities of ice that it can be stored in the weapon’s square barrel, sometimes making them appear more like bulky appliance than weapons. The more complex floe, glacier, and icecap ice launchers generate a large amount of ice in front of the barrel proper, steadying the mass with clawed protrusions before firing.;ar-ice-launcher;
AR;35;ar-ice-needle;Weapon;Ice Needle;;This handheld melee weapon appears to be nothing more than a handle with a slot in one end. Once a vial of an injectable substance is inserted into this slot, the ice needle forms a slender spike of ice around that liquid core, allowing you to inject the substance into a foe with a virtually untraceable weapon. Undercover and furtive ice needles are often used primarily for their injecting capabilities, while artifice, espionage, and subterfuge ice needles deal significant damage along with the injection.;ar-ice-needle;
AR;35;ar-icestar-staff;Weapon;Icestar Staff;;An icestar staff is an homage to the planet of Verces, where shirren immigrants making their first Pact Worlds home developed the weapon. One end of this staff glows with heat, while the other end shimmers with frost, offering the wielder the choice of which to use for each strike—a particular treat for its shirren creators. Icestar staves come in defender, seeker, warrior, drifter, and leader models.;ar-icestar-staff;
AR;38;ar-igniter;Weapon;Igniter;;An igniter has a deep-red crystal rod in place of a typical longarm barrel. This crystal focuses infrared light on a distant foe, causing the target to burst into flames. Assassins and drow in particular often favor the weapon due to its absence of any visible discharge. Ember, blaze, inferno, and solar flare igniters are common in many places.;ar-igniter;
AR;40;ar-infinity-rifle;Weapon;Infinity Rifle;;"Infinity rifles take their name from their shape, two conjoined rings similar to an infinity symbol with twin muzzles along the outer edge of one ring. The two rings contain a twisted loop of fiber-optic cabling that channels the laser beam; adding more energy to the loop results in a more powerful blast. These weapons were first introduced to the Pact Worlds by skittermanders (Starfinder Alien Archive 106), though their current nomenclature (tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon) was imposed by other weapons manufacturers.";ar-infinity-rifle;
AR;68;ar-inheritor’s-grace;Armor;Inheritor’s Grace;;"When first commissioned by the Church of Iomedae, this heavy armor was dubbed Armor of the Inheritor Ascendant. This cumbersome mouthful was
soon supplanted by the tongue-and-cheek nickname “Inheritor’s grace,” as “by her grace, we are protected.” Now only the dourest of Iomedae’s church refer to her armor by its proper title. Each suit of Inheritor’s grace armor constructed by the church receives blessings as part of its construction, though otherwise identical knock-offs and officially licensed suits also exist. The armor is extremely common among worshipers of Iomedae and Knights of Golarion, but it is also worn by those with no connection to her faith.
The base model of Inheritor’s grace makes use of lightweight alloy plates backed by energy-dissipating padding. More expensive models use heavier alloys and preserve mobility through reaction-feedback enhancements at each joint. A typical suit protects the wearer’s head with a projected force field for better visibility and a more commanding presence, but some eschew this in favor of battle helmets designed with an aesthetic similar to ancient helms.
";ar-inheritor’s-grace;
AR;44;ar-injector-pistol;Weapon;Injector Pistol;;"Manufacturers worked to the specifications of xenobiologists to design and produce these firearms, which use magnetic fields to accelerate darts loaded with various substances for injection into the target. They do so far less gently than the smaller needler pistol, however, and they have become a popular tool for poisoners, slavers, and others with less scientific intentions. Medic and zoologist injector pistols are often used by xenobiologists studying unintelligent species; poacher, subjugation, and elite injector pistols are generally regarded as illicit since they more often used to target sentient species, though most markets nevertheless carry the weapons.";ar-injector-pistol;
AR;63;ar-fusion-inspiring;WeaponFusion;INSPIRING;;The inspiring fusion imbues a weapon with hope. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the inspiring fusion, you and all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against attacks, effects, and spells from the target of your attack for 1 minute. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the inspiring effect.;ar-fusion-inspiring;
AR;50;ar-interference-blade;Weapon;Interference Blade;;The grip of an interference blade contains sonic projectors that emit specific ultrasonic frequencies, overlapping the sound waves until they become a physical edge. When you swing the weapon, this blade is visible as a blurred, translucent line. Monophonic interference blades generate a single pitch. Harmonic models use several pitches that amplify one another. A polyphonic blade projects variable frequencies, while a multiphonic version combines several frequencies in a single edge.;ar-interference-blade;
AR;64;ar-fusion-invigorating;WeaponFusion;INVIGORATING;;The invigorating fusion fills its wielder with vigor when defeating foes. After making a successful attack with this weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you feel a rush of energy that eliminates the fatigued condition and reduces exhaustion to fatigue. If you were neither exhausted nor fatigued, you instead gain a +3 morale bonus to Strength-, Dexterity- and Constitution-based ability checks and skill checks, and you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your speed for all of your modes of movement until the end of your next turn.;ar-fusion-invigorating;
AR;45;ar-ionizer;Weapon;Ionizer;;The ionizer’s beam ionizes a path to its target, which serves as a route for the ensuing electric charge. There are several different elemental ions used in constructing ionizers, with the strength of the output based on the metal used. The most common are cupric, ferric, chromic, and stannic ionizers. Generally, the weapon’s hardware is stored in two upgrade slots of a piece of armor, while a connected wand-like barrel extends from an extremity. Aballon’s anacites designed the first ionizers, but they have long since spread throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.;ar-ionizer;
AR;75;ar-ironclad-bulwark;PowArmor;Ironclad Bulwark;;This heavy suit of reinforced metal and polymer powered armor provides superior protection at the expense of mobility. It can mount melee weapons in its weapon slots, rather than only ranged weapons.;ar-ironclad-bulwark;
AR;38;ar-junk-censer;Weapon;Junk Censer;;"A chain, cable, or other cord connects the long handle of this weapon to a perforated or grated container that is filled with exceptionally volatile compounds. Few are foolish enough to use such a weapon, so there’s been little advancement on its design, but many space goblins use junk censers with reckless and even gleeful abandon. While it is most often wielded in melee, the junk censer can also be thrown at an enemy. Like many cobbled-together weapons, a junk censer is unstable; on an attack roll of a natural 1, it deals its regular damage to the user and gains the broken condition.";ar-junk-censer;
AR;70;ar-kalo-encounter-suit;Armor;Kalo Encounter Suit;;"When they first ventured beyond the frigid seas of Kalo- Mahoi, the kalo brought the waters of their moon with them in specially engineered suits. The kalo encounter suit represents the latest evolution of that design—a portable ocean that keeps the kalo at the near- freezing temperatures they prefer. The suit’s
air supply doubles as ballast to keep the wearer neutrally buoyant in water despite the armor’s weight, and the idiomatic design accommodates and protects the kalo’s swimming membranes. While the armor can be adapted to circulate water instead of air, kalos prefer their comfort
of their own technology. Similarly, the filters and seals of kalo encounter suits can be adapted to the needs of air breathers, although such suits tend to accumulate excess moisture and develop mold or mildew.
";ar-kalo-encounter-suit;
AR;75;ar-kyton-bloodsuit-(hybrid);PowArmor;Kyton Bloodsuit (hybrid);;This union of chains, metal plates, and magically solidified blood has a brutally functional appearance. Designed in cooperation with the pain-loving kytons of the Shadow Plane, kyton bloodsuits include clusters of blades and needles on the inside of the armor that shift about, seeking to pierce the wearer’s skin. The armor deals 1d4 damage to you each minute of operation (whenever the armor uses a charge). When you take this damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to restore 5 charges to the kyton bloodsuit, but you can’t restore more charges than it actually holds.;ar-kyton-bloodsuit-(hybrid);
AR;52;ar-lance;Weapon;Lance;;A lance is a long, heavy spear designed for use while riding a mount. While mounted or riding a cycle, you can wield a lance with one hand. This weapon is common across the Pact Worlds. Traditionally used by shotalashu warriors riding saurian mounts in the jungles of Castrovel and bonded ryphorian and dragonkin partners of Triaxus, lances are also known to have been common weapons on lost Golarion. Modern wielders use lances while mounted or driving open vehicles, such as cycle-riding raiders like the Vercite Rustrunners. Tactical lances are straightforward and widely available, while advanced lances are made of strong composites and have fine points to deal more damage. Elite lances have superfine points, and each has a particularly dense core for a more powerful strike. Paragon lances have been entirely redesigned using dense, flexible materials and an ultrathin point to achieve incomparable performance.;ar-lance;
AR;70;ar-lashunta-mind-mail;Armor;Lashunta Mind Mail;;"Each link in a suit of mind mail is a nanotechnological marvel: a psychically active circuit reactive to the thoughts of its wearer. When donned, mind mail floats just above the skin and alternates between rigidity and supple motion in response to its wearer’s thoughts and movement, with hundreds of tiny force fields filling the gaps between links as needed. The mail covers the entire body except for the face. The coif retracts into the collar at a mental command, and the mesh gloves likewise unlink and recede into the sleeves when a delicate touch is required. Mind mail offers a comfortable alternative to
climate control in tropical environs such as Castrovel, as the armor does not make direct contact with the body and the open mesh provides ample airflow. The wearers of mind mail often personalize their armor with intricate designs woven with varicolored metals into the pattern of the mail. These designs can be altered with an Engineering check at the same DC as a check for adjusting armor (Core Rulebook 196).";ar-lashunta-mind-mail;
AR;40;ar-lens-pistol;Weapon;Lens Pistol;;The lenses of this laser pistol reconfigure themselves for optimal focus between every shot, resulting in a more powerfully focused laser at a slower rate of fire. Cylindrical lens pistols and lenticular lens pistols focus their lasers using specially shaped lenses, while electron lens pistols and sunglass lens pistols are made of rarer materials and incorporate fine electronics.;ar-lens-pistol;
AR;45;ar-lightning-pistol;Weapon;Lightning Pistol;;When fired, this weapon erupts with a long, crackling bolt of electricity reminiscent of lightning. Sheet lightning pistols and ribbon lightning pistols are relatively common, but rocket and smooth-channel lightning pistols typically require a special license to carry legally.;ar-lightning-pistol;
AR;64;ar-fusion-limning;WeaponFusion;LIMNING;;"Successful attacks with a weapon with the limning fusion surround the target with a glowing aura.
For 1 round after you successfully attack a single creature with your weapon, it is surrounded by a pale glow that reveals its location. While so illuminated, the creature takes a –20 penalty to Stealth
checks and does not benefit from concealment provided by
darkness, invisibility, smoke, and similar effects. However, displacement and other effects that shift location entirely are not negated. The light is too dim to harm creatures vulnerable to light and does not serve to illuminate anything but
the creature affected by limning. Limning weapons create glows in a variety of hues, and some even bestow a variety of colors. The limning fusion has no effect on attacks that affect multiple foes.";ar-fusion-limning;
AR;52;ar-living-lash;Weapon;Living Lash;;"A living lash is grown from a network of filaments closely related to neural fibers, and it remains biologically active after its creation. This living connection to neurophysiology makes the weapon easy to manipulate using telepathy, but it’s difficult to wield without such abilities. These weapons are common only on worlds with telepathic species.
 
";ar-living-lash;
AR;53;ar-living-staff;Weapon;Living Staff;;Xenodruids developed the living staff, a gnarled and vine- swathed pole, to use as a weapon and a sign of their allegiance. The staff itself can extend, and the vines can wrap around and entangle a target. Xenodruids on sentinel duty favor the tactical and advanced models. The elite and paragon models are more common among highly skilled warrior-mystics undertaking assault missions.;ar-living-staff;
AR;38;ar-magma-blade;Weapon;Magma Blade;;Though this sturdy sword appears to be made of stone when inactive, once powered the blade cracks and melts into a glowing bar of magma held in place by magnetic fields. The incredible heat inflicts grievous injuries on targets. Rhyolite magma blades are the most affordable model, andesite and basalt magma blades have increased intensity, and the formidable plagioclase magma blade is the most dangerous.;ar-magma-blade;
AR;64;ar-fusion-malediction;WeaponFusion;MALEDICTION;;Once per day when you successfully attack a foe with a weapon with the malediction fusion, as a reaction you can cast bestow curse on the target as a spell-like ability (using the weapon’s item level as the caster level). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the malediction fusion if it also has either the holy or merciful weapon fusions.;ar-fusion-malediction;
AR;53;ar-maul;Weapon;Maul;;Outsized hammers, mauls are valued for their intimidation factor and effectiveness in battle. A tactical maul is as much an instrument for hammering posts into the ground as a weapon. Advanced mauls include dense, heavy cores to deliver a more forceful blow. Elite mauls and paragon mauls are designed and manufactured more for war than labor, although the weapons can be used as tools.;ar-maul;
AR;64;ar-fusion-menacing;WeaponFusion;MENACING;;A weapon with the menacing fusion aggressively pushes against your foe’s guard, making way for other attackers. When you hit an enemy with a melee attack using a menacing weapon, that enemy is considered flanked for all other melee attackers until the start of your next turn. This weapon fusion does not provide any benefit to your own attacks. Only melee weapons can benefit from the menacing fusion.;ar-fusion-menacing;
AR;38;ar-meteor-glaive;Weapon;Meteor Glaive;;The glaive is an ancient weapon, originally developed for use by and against mounted warriors. The meteor glaive is the Skyfire Legion’s update on the original design, incorporating a petrol tank near the base of the slightly curved blade and relying on a long shaft to keep the wielder at a safe distance. Meteor glaives are classified into tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models.;ar-meteor-glaive;
AR;42;ar-microfusion-rifle;Weapon;Microfusion Rifle;;The microfusion rifle is built around a bulbous miniaturized fusion reactor. Plasma is generated and placed under incredible pressure in the reactor before being vented in a sudden blast that sometimes carries dangerous levels of radiation. The sparse shielding on light microfusion rifles often results in the users incurring radiation poisoning, so they tend to be used by undertrained militias that can’t afford (or lack the judgment to use) safer heavy weapons. Medium and heavy microfusion rifles are built with larger reactors, which prove more dangerous to their users and targets alike.;ar-microfusion-rifle;
AR;54;ar-microserrated-shuriken;Weapon;Microserrated Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. This is like the carbonedge variety, but has microserrated edges to slice into targets better.;ar-microserrated-shuriken;
AR;64;ar-fusion-mind-rending;WeaponFusion;MIND RENDING;;"Scoring a critical hit with a weapon with the mind rending fusion damages the psyche of the creature struck. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save; otherwise, roll on the Psychic Trauma table to determine how the target creature is affected. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or a psychic trauma. Psychic trauma is a mind- affecting effect. While each psychic trauma exploits a potential neurosis, the trauma does not cause actual insanity. The effects of psychic trauma can be removed with the remove affliction spell (DC = 15 + half the item level of the mind rending weapon).

AR;53;ar-minelayer;Weapon;Minelayer;;A specialized form of grenade launcher, a minelayer surrounds its ordnance with a cushioning magnetic field. Grenades must be loaded into a minelayer individually, and a user can decide which grenade to fire with each shot. A merc minelayer holds up to 8 grenades at once, a squad model holds 12, a platoon version can carry up to 16, and the command minelayer can hold an impressive 20 grenades.;ar-minelayer;
AR;70;ar-mining-jack;Armor;Mining Jack;;"Asteroid miners wear mining jacks for both life support and protection against the hazards of vacuum mining. As they are designed for use in low and zero gravity, the jacks are quite bulky, with alloys chosen for strength and durability rather than weight. Because miners often spend the entire day in a vacuum, mining jacks have storage compartments accessible within the armor. The breastplate of a mining jack can expand outward without being removed, allowing the wearer a modest amount of space to pull her arms inside and enjoy a beverage or meal. Each suit includes a pair of miniature airlocks that allow safe transfer of small objects from outside to inside the suit as a full action. A pair
of mining jacks can even link locks to trade gear without exposing the item or either wearer to vacuum. The first mining jacks were dwarven designs, but their ingenious design and utility have made them popular throughout the Diaspora.";ar-mining-jack;
AR;38;ar-mirage-dagger;Weapon;Mirage Dagger;;"The mirage dagger is an elegant one-handed blade that expels an aura of superheated air that causes visible distortions in the air around it. This minor displacement effect makes it easier to catch enemies off guard with it. A wide, circular guard protects the wielder’s hand while the blade is active. Distortion mirage daggers are the standard model; hallucination and illusion mirage daggers feature increased damage capabilities.";ar-mirage-dagger;
AR;44;ar-multistage-rifle;Weapon;Multistage Rifle;;The multistage rifle requires mini-rocket ammunition, which it detonates in multiple stages. The initial firing of the weapon is a subsonic round that’s boosted by one or more subsequent, stronger discharges some distance from the user. This results in two effects that aid in obfuscating the user’s position: the sound of the weapon firing is displaced, and the later stages can cause subtle changes in direction, creating an impact angle that suggests the mini-rocket had been fired from a different angle. Dual and dual-plus multistage rifles use a two-stage firing process, while triple and triple-plus multistage rifles employ a three-stage process for added range. The quad multistage rifle is the only weapon on the market with an unrivaled four-stage firing process for maximum damage.;ar-multistage-rifle;
AR;49;ar-muon-crystal;Weapon;Muon Crystal;;Theoretically kin to the electron crystal, a muon crystal turns its user’s solar weapon into a wispy glow in shimmering colors, closer to the auroras certain worlds experience than the unadulterated light of a star. This diffuse weapon slides easily through most matter, making it easier to tear through living creatures and inanimate objects alike. Muon crystals are available in least, minor, lesser, standard, and greater varieties.;ar-muon-crystal;
AR;55;ar-nanite-canisters;BattleWare;Nanite Canisters;;Nanite canisters contain microscopic mechanical devices programmed to perform specific tasks. In weapons, they are typically tasked to dismantle as much of the target as they can before they are deactivated, but nanotechnology also has a wide range of peaceful uses.;ar-nanite-canisters;
AR;37;ar-nanite-decoupler;Weapon;Nanite Decoupler;;While most disintegrator weapons produce a stream of energy that strikes a single target, a nanite decoupler programs nanites to replicate a disintegrator’s destructive energies over a set area. The integrated generators used to overcharge the nanites for the desired effect make a nanite decoupler a heavy, bulky weapon that requires a skilled user. The caustic nanite decoupler and the vitriolic nanite decoupler are both deadly, destructive weapons.;ar-nanite-decoupler;
AR;53;ar-nanite-rifle;Weapon;Nanite Rifle;;Nanite rifles can fire nanotech-infused darts at targets from extreme ranges. Although the darts deal little damage, the nanites eat into the target immediately and can cause grievous injuries. Nanites from tactical models target the site where they land, while an advanced rifle’s nanites can spread farther within the target. An elite rifle allows its nanites to move even farther from the point struck, dealing more damage.;ar-nanite-rifle;
AR;53;ar-nanite-thrower;Weapon;Nanite Thrower;;A nanite thrower has a cylindrical nanite canister above the stock, which serves as ammunition. Instead of firing a single projectile, the nanite thrower hurls a coherent cluster of nanites at the target. These microscopic machines burrow in and damage the target from within. Nanite throwers come in similar models to the nanite rifle—tactical, advanced, and elite. With throwers, however, this line extends to the paragon model.;ar-nanite-thrower;
AR;45;ar-neural-lash;Weapon;Neural Lash;;Similar to the living lash, a neural lash is a particularly flexible weapon that proves cumbersome to those without telepathic abilities. The neural lash has been bred to include bioelectric cells in addition to its neural fibers, delivering electricity damage and allowing the lash to deal nonlethal damage at its user’s direction. Barathu take credit for the development of the electroplax and amperometric neural lash, but later weapons manufacturers have improved upon those original models by developing the galvanic and voltaic neural lashes.;ar-neural-lash;
AR;70;ar-night-plate;Armor;Night Plate;;Based on designs reverse-engineered from ancient troves and alloys rediscovered through painstaking research, night plate is the heavy armor of choice for the drow of Apostae. It blends archaic armor sensibilities with cutting-edge technology, resulting in an appearance that resembles a metallic construct as much as armor. Night plate’s design incorporates flaring cauldrons and razor-sharp leg spurs, though these impressive adornments have little function beyond intimidation. Higher-grade models incorporate even more of these embellishments, cunningly designed to avoid interference with the armor’s primary functions.;ar-night-plate;
AR;42;ar-nova-lance;Weapon;Nova Lance;;This long weapon bears a plasma sheath at its striking tip. Although similar weapons are produced on many worlds, nova lances’ use in Eoxian racing broadcasts has made them especially popular throughout the Pact Worlds. They are typically manufactured by corporations that specialize in plasma pistols and plasma rifles and thus their models follow the same naming conventions: red star, yellow star, white star, and blue star.;ar-nova-lance;
AR;42;ar-nova-rifle;Weapon;Nova Rifle;;Much like traditional plasma rifles, nova rifles fire coherent gouts of plasma that can potentially travel some distance and burn multiple targets. However, nova rifles have a slimmer profile overall but a larger aperture, projecting plasma that’s both slightly cooler and more diffuse. The nova rifle’s intense visual display makes it a favorite of icons looking to make a statement or simply add pyrotechnics to their shows. Red star, yellow star, and white star nova rifles are all easily identified by the color of their plasma arcs.;ar-nova-rifle;
AR;64;ar-fusion-nullifying;WeaponFusion;NULLIFYING;;Damage from a weapon with the nullifying fusion temporarily reduces spell resistance. When you damage a creature with spell resistance using a weapon with this fusion, its spell resistance is reduced by 2 until the end of your next turn. Multiple hits from weapons with this fusion stack.;ar-fusion-nullifying;
AR;35;ar-numbing-beam;Weapon;Numbing Beam;;"Complex algorithms, controls, and safeguards
within a numbing beam ensure the weapon never lowers its target’s temperature to lethal levels. Tactical and advanced numbing beams see use in populated areas, while elite and paragon numbing beams are more often employed in military endeavors. Those models intended for use near civilians include prominent external computer interfaces, as though to advertise their safety features, while military models tend toward a sleek, traditional design.
";ar-numbing-beam;
AR;64;ar-fusion-obscuring;WeaponFusion;OBSCURING;;"A weapon with the obscuring fusion emits mist, smoke, or a similar obscuring vapor when wielded. After attacking with the weapon, as a move action you can cause the weapon to emit enough vapor to conceal you until the start of your next turn. This effect ends immediately if you move for any reason from where you made your attack. This concealment does not interfere with your attacks or benefit others, even if they move into the space you attacked from, and you can’t use
it to hide. Conditions such as strong wind or vacuum that quickly disperse vapors negate this concealment. Only projectile weapons or those that deal cold or fire damage can benefit from this fusion.";ar-fusion-obscuring;
AR;64;ar-fusion-opportunistic;WeaponFusion;OPPORTUNISTIC;;The opportunistic fusion guides your accuracy when making attacks of opportunity and leaves your foes vulnerable to your attack. You gain a +2 bonus to attacks of opportunity made with this weapon. If your attack of opportunity hits, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll for that attack of opportunity. This damage increases by 1 if the weapon is item level 5, and by an additional 1 for every 5 item levels thereafter. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-opportunistic;
AR;50;ar-perforator-pistol;Weapon;Perforator Pistol;;Focused sound waves from a perforator pistol punch through objects and bodies. Drow employ perforators because the dark elves enjoy the weapon’s ability to inflict gruesome wounds, which are as effective against morale as against life and limb. Diffraction and refraction perforator pistols align and compound sound waves, while linear and phased perforator pistols are named for the internal matrices that focus wavelengths the pistols emitters generate.;ar-perforator-pistol;
AR;75;ar-personal-submersible;PowArmor;Personal Submersible;;This bulky, bulbous armor is made of pressure-resistant plates with durable seals. Retractable ridges along the armor’s arms, legs, and back function as fins, providing increased mobility in most fluids. The armor grants you a swim speed and allows you to both breathe underwater and survive the pressure of thick atmospheres and great depths even when your environmental protections are not active.;ar-personal-submersible;
AR;42;ar-persuader;Weapon;Persuader;;"This small, brutish sidearm fires a surprisingly large globule of plasma that stretches into a rope as it travels, sometimes inflicting terrible wounds on its target. It is a perennial favorite of officers in the Veskarium; those seeking to surprise and intimidate their foes use the weapon’s reputation to their advantage. Although the first persuaders date back to the Silent War and are considered rare collectibles in the Pact Worlds, dozens of manufacturers make their own modern versions.";ar-persuader;
AR;38;ar-petrol-converter;Weapon;Petrol Converter;;This longarm has an extra cylinder connected to the petrol tank that contains a series of converter filters housing active bacteria. Diverting the petrol flow through this system before firing allows the bacteria to convert the fuel into acid. In addition to the tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon petrol converters, manufacturers have produced a light petrol converter for industrial applications.;ar-petrol-converter;
AR;55;ar-phasing;BattleWare;Phasing;;This ammunition is tipped with quantum-variable molecules, allowing it to phase through many materials prior to impacting with its target. If you take a move action to aim and then fire on the same turn a weapon with phasing ammo (including doing so with a sniper weapon), the attack ignores any cover the target has with a hardness equal to given value or less (hardness 10 for 7th-level rounds, hardness 20 for 14th-level rounds). The rounds literally bypass the cover, doing no damage to it.;ar-phasing;
AR;49;ar-photon-crystal;Weapon;Photon Crystal;;A photon crystal adds compressed photonic energy to a weapon strike, adding fire damage and the potential to burn the target. The shard photon crystal is presented here, while other models can be found in the Core Rulebook.;ar-photon-crystal;
AR;42;ar-plasma-array;Weapon;Plasma Array;;"A retractable coarse mesh of electromagnetically protected wire covers the wide muzzle of a plasma array; this mesh breaks apart plasma into a flurry of discrete charges. Plasma arrays are manufactured in the typical classifications for plasma weapons: red star, yellow star, white star, and blue star.";ar-plasma-array;
AR;42;ar-plasma-bolter;Weapon;Plasma Bolter;;One of the most common ranged weapons used by the vesk military during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, the plasma bolter is a particularly hefty longarm with a bulky profile that speaks to its vesk origins. Unlike most common ranged plasma weapons, which lay out long lines of plasma or boost their output, plasma bolters focus on delivering a single heavy bolt of plasma. These weapons saw extensive use in fighting back the Swarm, and now many can be easily obtained on the open market as Pact Worlds manufacturers have begun offering their own tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models of the classic weapon.;ar-plasma-bolter;
AR;42;ar-plasma-claw;Weapon;Plasma Claw;;The Xenowardens bioengineered these large arthropod claws based on a creature from a lost world in the Vast—the claws create a burst of plasma as they snap shut. The organic plasma claw and biodynamic plasma claw models function most similarly to the original creature. Other manufacturers have created the slightly different electrocellular and synthecite models, which are less powerful versions of the two earlier models.;ar-plasma-claw;
AR;42;ar-plasma-fork;Weapon;Plasma Fork;;Also known as a plasma rail gun, a plasma fork has two long metal prongs in place of a barrel. The mechanism magnetically accelerates a bolt of plasma between these two prongs, but it can also hold plasma temporarily between the prongs to charge up an even more devastating attack. Each model has a number of notches that infuse the plasma with energy, starting with 12-notch plasma forks and increasing in intensity to 15-notch, 19-notch, and 22-notch plasma forks.;ar-plasma-fork;
AR;43;ar-plasma-guide;Weapon;Plasma Guide;;"A plasma guide maintains a magnetic guidance system around its plasma discharge, which continues guiding the shot after it is fired. This increases accuracy at ranges far beyond those of typical plasma weapons and bypasses the advantage of partial cover as the magnetic guidance directs the plasma toward its target. Vesk snipers are believed to be the earliest users of the plasma guide during the Silent War, but it’s become a standard in many military and mercenary arsenals since then. This weapon has been continually refined since its invention; series-21, series-28, series-37, series-42, series-62, and series-73 plasma guides have proven generally stable and thus remain in production.";ar-plasma-guide;
AR;43;ar-plasma-lash;Weapon;Plasma Lash;;A plasma lash has a sturdy, braided handle with a thick but flexible cord that divides into several narrower cables as it gets farther from the handle, each trailing lines of uncontained plasma. These weapons come in red star, yellow star, white star and blue star models.;ar-plasma-lash;
AR;55;ar-plasma-missile;BattleWare;Plasma Missile;;Compatible with any weapon that can use missiles as ammunition, plasma missiles deal additional damage beyond even their analog counterparts, and come with an increased price tag to match. Ionized plasma missiles are the most common, while stellar plasma missiles and HED (high energy density) plasma missiles deal increased amounts of damage.;ar-plasma-missile;
AR;43;ar-plasma-ribbon;Weapon;Plasma Ribbon;;"While analog battle ribbons (see page 52) are the most traditional of such weapons, increased demand for showier displays in recent centuries has resulted in the development of the plasma ribbon. Much like the analog version, a plasma ribbon is a 10-foot-long ribbon about 3 inches wide, though this version is made from impermeable nanocarbon fiber. A series of fine, flexible wires along the edges produces a narrow magnetic field that turns the weapon into a streamer of glowing plasma in use. Student plasma ribbons allow the user to build up proficiency; battleflowers trade up to professional, competitor, and champion plasma ribbons as they become more skilled with the weapons.";ar-plasma-ribbon;
AR;43;ar-plasma-ring;Weapon;Plasma Ring;;Plasma rings are relatively flat, circular weapons with an easily grippable interior, allowing them to be used in a variety of orientations. Plasma cycles through a channel within the ring at high speeds, and a release valve allows a stream of plasma to escape in a directed jet. Single-valve plasma rings produce a small discharge, while dual-valve plasma rings have a synchronized pair of valves to produce a larger discharge. Multichannel plasma rings build plasma in a series of parallel rings that vent into a single release valve for an extremely powerful blast.;ar-plasma-ring;
AR;48;ar-polarity-gauntlets;Weapon;Polarity Gauntlets;;Polarity gauntlets fit snugly over the wearer’s extremities, and when activated, the two gloves generate an arc of electricity between them. Due to the alternating currents, subsequent attacks deal additional damage: each strike that hits a target after the first in rapid succession deals additional damage. The popularity of these weapons has led to the proliferation of different versions, including the cheap but potent spark and static models, the midrange aurora and current models, and the powerful storm and tempest polarity gauntlets. Kasathan warriors who maintain their cultural predilection for melee combat favor polarity gauntlets as an effective weapon that aligns with their martial values.;ar-polarity-gauntlets;
AR;48;ar-polarity-rifle;Weapon;Polarity Rifle;;The polarity rifle was designed by Vercite engineers using the conceptual model that underpins polarity gauntlets. This rifle’s prongs are separately polarized, and it alternates between them as it fires to create a circuit of lightning between the gun and target, causing subsequent attacks to deal additional damage. Static, aurora, storm, and tempest polarity rifles are favored by sharpshooters in many fields, though they are often scorned by kasathas who view them as a vulgarized appropriation of an honorable weapon.;ar-polarity-rifle;
AR;49;ar-positron-crystal;Weapon;Positron Crystal;;"A positron crystal’s interactions with matter release both heat and radiation, causing a solar weapon it enhances to roar with flame as it strikes enemies. This adds fire damage to the weapon’s strikes and adds the irradiate critical hit effect to critical hits scored with the weapon. Unlike many radioactive weapons, a solar weapon enhanced by a positron crystal does not pose any particular risk to its user, although the reason behind this remains unknown. Research into precisely how to preserve these crystals is ongoing; currently only least, minor, and lesser versions remain stable for more than a few seconds, though these are quite powerful.";ar-positron-crystal;
AR;64;ar-fusion-potent;WeaponFusion;POTENT;;The potent fusion boosts the DC of saving throws associated with the weapon. When you attack using a weapon with this fusion, increase the DC for saving throws against the weapon’s critical hit effects, other weapon fusions, weapon special properties, and any effect delivered by the weapon (such as an injected poison) by 1.;ar-fusion-potent;
AR;70;ar-preserver’s-mantle;Armor;Preserver’s Mantle;;The Xenowardens bioengineered the preserver’s mantle as a form of living armor. Rather than donning the mantle, a creature steps onto it and allows the armor to wrap itself around and over the creature’s body. Insulating moss acts as padding, while vines and wood match the strength of the advanced composites of other light armors. When the armor’s environmental protections are activated, the external surface of the plants interlace into an airtight barrier, while the moss regulates the temperature and converts exhaled gases back into breathable air. Like other armors, the mantle must be adjusted to fit a new wearer (though this requires a Life Science check, rather than an Engineering check.;ar-preserver’s-mantle;
AR;53;ar-psychic-wave-cannon;Weapon;Psychic-Wave Cannon;;Unlike weapons that rely on physical projectiles or various energy forms to damage a target, a psychic-wave cannon targets a creature’s mind. The cannon contains an organic neural matrix that converts charges into a mental blast, damaging creatures with overwhelming psychic output. The numeral of a psychic- wave cannon’s model indicates the strength of its output, but the weapon can’t harm objects and mindless creatures, as well as those immune to mind-affecting effects.;ar-psychic-wave-cannon;
AR;39;ar-pulse-grenade;BattleWare;Pulse Grenade;;A pulse grenade emits a powerful EMP blast on impact whose damage and effects apply only to constructs with the technological subtype. Constructs reduced to 0 HP by a pulse grenade are not destroyed but simply nonfunctional until restored to 1 or more Hit Points. The EMP wave from a pulse grenade is not intense enough to affect augmentations, weapons, armor, or other technological gear.;ar-pulse-grenade;
AR;65;ar-fusion-punishingng;WeaponFusion;PUNISHINGNG;;Subsequent wounds from a weapon with the punishing fusion have greater effect. When you damage a creature with the weapon, you receive a +1 bonus to damage against that target with this weapon until the end of your turn. If you successfully damage the same creature with this weapon multiple times in the same round, the bonus increases by 1 on each additional attack. If you damage a creature with this weapon when it isn’t your turn, such as with an attack of opportunity, the bonus lasts until the end of your next turn after the attack.;ar-fusion-punishingng;
AR;53;ar-puzzleblade;Weapon;Puzzleblade;;The kasathan puzzleblade is a two-handed sword that can be disassembled into pieces for ease of storage and transport, although reassembling the blade for use takes some time. Many who carry a puzzleblade see the assembly time as a reminder of virtues to uphold, so the various types of puzzleblades take their names from kasathan values of conviction, dedication, moderation, and tradition. Some ysoki, on the other hand, have taken a liking to the weapon due to the fact that the disassembled pieces can be stored in ysoki cheek pouches.;ar-puzzleblade;
AR;38;ar-pyrod;Weapon;Pyrod;;Constructed from an insulated tube containing an integrated petrol tank with a nozzle on one end, pyrods expel a gout of flame when swung with force. The weapons are used in lashunta dance and performance combat as often as in earnest melee, and many bear elegant laser engraving, sculpted grips, or other aesthetically pleasing elements. Luminous pyrods are produced with a greater eye toward aesthetics, while torch pyrods and beacon pyrods are designed to maximize their firepower.;ar-pyrod;
AR;38;ar-radcannon;Weapon;Radcannon;;Radcannons are large, dangerous-to-wield weapons typically employed by desperate, reckless, or unliving users. A radcannon’s high-voltage capacitors channel energy through a magnetron and transformer to generate massive blasts of radioactive waves, burning targets and typically exposing the target—and potentially the user—to dangerous levels of radiation. Devourer cultists often employ electromagnetic radcannons, neutron radcannons, and even rapid-decay radcannons, unfazed by the weapons’ danger.;ar-radcannon;
AR;38;ar-radshot;Weapon;Radshot;;Banned in most civilized regions of the Pact Worlds, radshots are known for the reckless amount of radiation they generate. Despite the objections of the living, radshots’ signature short barrels and bulky containment sheaths can often be seen in the markets of Eox or at the hip of a Corpse Fleet officer. They are named for the type of radiation waves they emit: electromagnetic, neutron, and rapid-decay.;ar-radshot;
AR;44;ar-rail-cannon;Weapon;Rail Cannon;;"Rail cannons are scaled-up versions of rail guns, and like rail guns, they use magnetic fields to rapidly accelerate ammunition. A rail cannon generates such phenomenal force that its rounds can pass entirely through multiple targets, allowing the user to hit multiple targets in a line. Tactical rail cannons are precise and effective, while advanced rail cannons offer more firepower; elite and paragon rail cannons are generally used only by heavy- weapons specialists in professional military groups.";ar-rail-cannon;
AR;44;ar-rail-gun;Weapon;Rail Gun;;Similar in design to the magnetar rifle, a rail gun uses magnetic fields to accelerate its rounds to lethal speeds. While magnetar rifles are more powerful, they’re also larger and heavier, leaving many to favor the smaller and lighter rail gun. The weapons’ affordability makes them a popular choice for members of the Starfinder Society and other exploratory groups. Rail guns come in tactical and advanced models, with the advanced rail gun being slightly larger.;ar-rail-gun;
AR;75;ar-reactor-guard;PowArmor;Reactor Guard;;This heavy, awkward armor is built with the highest levels of radiation shielding and anti-radiation materials known in the Pact Worlds. Primarily used to lift ultra-dense materials within reactor cores, reactor guard armor is useful for anyone fighting or working in areas with toxic levels of radiation. You and the armor are both immune to radiation (Core Rulebook 403) even when your environmental protections are not active, and you can’t contract radiation sickness while wearing the armor.;ar-reactor-guard;
AR;65;ar-fusion-rebounding;WeaponFusion;REBOUNDING;;The rebounding fusion lets you bounce your attacks off a wall to reach your target. When making a ranged attack, you can ricochet your attack off a single solid barrier into your target. You take a –4 penalty to your attack roll. You must have line of sight to your target, and your target still benefits from any applicable concealment. Calculate cover based on the point you ricochet from. The fusion prevents any damage to the barrier and allows you to carom shots at apparently impossible angles. You can’t ricochet off a barrier your weapon would automatically pass through, such as rebounding a laser off a transparent surface, but you can ricochet off a barrier that your weapon would normally destroy. A thrown weapon with both the rebounding and returning fusions returns as normal, rebounding off the barrier again on its way back to you. Only thrown and ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-rebounding;
AR;71;ar-regimental-dress;Armor;Regimental Dress;;Regimental dress is the light armor counterpart to ceremonial plate. Often stylized to the extreme, regimental dress comes in as many variations as there are military forces, militias, and private security details. Regimental dress uses advanced fibers and strategically placed ceramic plates to avoid ruining the design lines of the uniforms. A force field projector concealed in the collar activates as needed to provide life support and protection for the head. Integrated holographic imaging projects rank insignia, medals, and ribbons, and supports gesture-activated informational displays for each honor.;ar-regimental-dress;
AR;71;ar-reinforced-eva-suit;Armor;Reinforced EVA Suit;;Although designed for extravehicular activity in hazardous conditions, reinforced EVA suits function as durable, if clunky, heavy armor. This full-body suit has a rigid shell covering the back and chest, with heavy gloves, padded boots, and rugged fabric rounding out the ensemble. A wide helmet design provides good visibility and includes a retractable glare shield. The suit’s excellent air recycling makes for a more comfortable environment than many more battle-worthy designs.;ar-reinforced-eva-suit;
AR;39;ar-resistance-rod;Weapon;Resistance Rod;;The metal rod has a carefully insulated grip and a resistance coil designed to generate substantial heat surrounding the bulk of the baton’s shaft. Though the weapon is named for its engineering, it is often used by members of the Android Abolitionist Front and other rebel groups because of its evocative name and ease of construction. Strain- gauge resistance rods retain some flexibility and are easier to use, while thermistor and piezoresistor resistance rods employ more advanced coils to generate a hotter output. Induction resistance rods operate at higher outputs and are significantly more dangerous.;ar-resistance-rod;
AR;50;ar-resonant-gauntlet;Weapon;Resonant Gauntlet;;"The translucent crystal network in a resonant gauntlet has its origins in the rings of the gas giant Liavara. The rings contain crystal fragments thought to record every sonic vibration that passes through them. Researchers have yet to fully decode the information they hold, but they have been able to develop a material that shares some of the crystal’s properties.
A resonant gauntlet is a long glove with composited crystal and metal around the user’s wrist, forearm, and knuckles. When a wearer strikes, the composite generates a harmful resonance that can be directed into a target’s body, rupturing cell walls and causing organ stress. The wearer can increase the effect by flexing the limb and digits under the gauntlet, causing the crystal to record the subtle sounds of the body and its component matter to build stronger resonance. The cellular resonance gauntlet is the basic model. Focused frequencies of the molecular, atomic, and quantum models stimulate respectively smaller components of matter to deal correspondingly large amounts of damage.";ar-resonant-gauntlet;
AR;50;ar-resonant-pistol;Weapon;Resonant Pistol;;"The crystalline structure inside a resonant pistol comes from the same synthetic material used in the resonant gauntlet. An electrical current can be directed through a long, conical barrel fitted with layers of the crystal, causing the material to reverberate with a devastating
ultrasonic frequency. These weapons are noted for their ease of use, since they create no recoil. The only indication that these weapons have fired is a faint, high-pitched beep. Resonant pistols using a crystal lattice are more common and less expensive than those that contain a crystal matrix.";ar-resonant-pistol;
AR;50;ar-resonant-staff;Weapon;Resonant Staff;;The weapon known as the resonant staff has a history that runs parallel to origins of the resonant gauntlet and resonant pistol. A similar crystalline structure tuned to particular frequencies turns electricity into sound as it agitates the crystal. The sonorous staff is named for the pleasant tone it strikes, while the reverberant model echoes with a few different tones. A stentorian resonant staff is like the reverberant model but punctuates its blows with distinctive sonic cracks.;ar-resonant-staff;
AR;50;ar-resonator;Weapon;Resonator;;A resonator is a boxy device with a terminal along the top and a series of concentric rings of metal and crystal in front to focus the weapon’s harmonics. A shoulder strap helps offset the weapon’s considerable weight, allowing the use of a top handle to direct output while freeing up the other hand to operate the controls. A resonator generates sonic waves at frequencies set to resound within the targeted material, allowing the weapon to deal precise damage regardless of the target’s composition or protection. If the integrated probing function is employed before firing, the resonator’s sonic frequencies can be precisely tuned. Diffraction and refraction resonators align sonic waves in specific patterns, while linear and phased resonators focus the sonic energy through specialized matrices for amplified output.;ar-resonator;
AR;53;ar-retractable-spike;Weapon;Retractable Spike;;These keen-edged spikes are installed in an armor upgrade slot rather than held, stored in a surface slot in armor or an android’s body until extended. You can extend the spike as a move action and retract the spike as a swift action. Such a spike usually extends from the elbow, foot, knee, or wrist, but a spike can be fitted into a helmet or an android’s head for use in head- butting or goring foes. Retractable spikes are widely available throughout the Pact Worlds, with the various models—tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon—having individual rarity based on the credit outlay to acquire a given model.;ar-retractable-spike;
AR;39;ar-riot-grenade;BattleWare;Riot Grenade;;Riot grenades are standard issue among police forces, as they deal nonlethal damage and slow the movements of creatures affected by the blast.;ar-riot-grenade;
AR;44;ar-rocket-rifle;Weapon;Rocket Rifle;;A rocket rifle is a longarm that uses mini-rockets as ammunition. The weapon and its ammunition are both quite expensive, but they make up for it in firepower. Rocket rifles came into heavy use at the onset of the war with the Swarm, often employed by daring soldiers on high-risk missions into Swarm strongholds.;ar-rocket-rifle;
AR;44;ar-rotating-pistol;Weapon;Rotating Pistol;;A rotating pistol is a modern execution of an ancient design found on Golarion and several other worlds. The multiple barrels on this pistol rotate while firing to dissipate heat, which allows a more powerful shot without melting the weapon. The rotating pistol’s shots deal significant damage to their target, but the weapon requires frequent reloading. Rotating pistols are available in tactical, advanced, and elite models.;ar-rotating-pistol;
AR;41;ar-rotolaser;Weapon;Rotolaser;;A rotolaser uses much of the same technology as autobeam artillery, but in addition to directing its beam through a rotating array of lenses, it also uses a rotating array of barrels that creates a series of short laser blasts. This rotating assembly helps the weapon to survive the heat and stress of rapid fire. Rotolasers come in tactical and advanced versions.;ar-rotolaser;
AR;53;ar-sap;Weapon;Sap;;A weapon dating back to antiquity, a sap is shaped like a large, flat spoon with a heavily weighted end. Archaeological digs have verified that almost every society develops an analog to the sap. Modern versions are constructed from high-tech fiber and dense alloys. Although sap models are referred to as light, medium, and heavy by users, it’s the rare materials used in various models, and not their actual weight, that make them progressively better at bludgeoning victims into unconsciousness.;ar-sap;
AR;39;ar-scorchgun;Weapon;Scorchgun;;Common in areas where petrol’s flammability is a liability, such as in the protected jungles of Castrovel, scorchguns employ a microwave emitter to burn targets. The emitter is generally a squat cylinder positioned above the pistol’s trigger, and its adjustable output allows a wielder to deal either lethal or nonlethal damage. The original design, the microwave scorchgun, is the most widely used, and later designs focus on a specific bandwidth, with S-band, C-band, K-band, and X-band scorchguns achieving progressively more power and precision.;ar-scorchgun;
AR;75;ar-scrapper's-rig;PowArmor;Scrapper's Rig;;Most often constructed by desperate scavengers or goblins, a scrapper’s rig is a mismatched, ungainly amalgamation of exposed wires, steel plates, and leaky hydraulics. You cannot run or charge when wearing a scrapper’s rig.;ar-scrapper's-rig;
AR;53;ar-scythe;Weapon;Scythe;;Few weapons send a more distinctive and imposing message than a scythe, given its longstanding and transcultural connotations of harvest and death. A far cry from the farming tools of ages past, scythes range from tactical to sintered to ultrathin models. Followers of Urgathoa make up a significant portion of the customer base for this weapon.;ar-scythe;
AR;39;ar-searing-grip;Weapon;Searing Grip;;"The searing grip was originally designed for artists who craft their visions in various metals. The grip has several layers of insulation to separate the wearer’s hand from the resistance coils lining the palm and fingers; as such, the glove is often mistaken for a simple well-insulated work glove. Lengthy application of this heat can soften many metals, which aids in sculpting efforts, but even a quick touch can inflict painful burns, allowing searing grips to double as low-profile weapons. The versions typically employed by sculptors are designated low-heat and high-heat, though this is a relative distinction, as both operate at temperatures capable of dealing substantial damage. The weaponized searing grip drops the pretense of being an artist’s tool, though those trained in its use find that its functionality doesn’t differ substantially from the other models.";ar-searing-grip;
AR;65;ar-fusion-secured;WeaponFusion;SECURED;;"The secured fusion ties the weapon to a single owner. When you use your weapon, it functions normally, but when wielded by any other, it remains inert and useless. Any analog, nonmagical properties of the weapon that do not require ammunition or charges still function, so a club would still be a club, but a pistol becomes merely an improvised weapon. Only the person who places a secured fusion seal on a weapon can remove it from that weapon. Once removed, the fusion seal can be affixed to a new weapon by a new owner. Even if not the owner, a character trained in Mysticism can remove an installed secured fusion or fusion seal using a process similar to transferring a fusion (Core Rulebook 191). For a fusion, this costs half as much as purchasing the fusion for the weapon on which it is currently installed; for a seal, this is half the cost of the seal itself. The process takes 8 hours. Afterward, a fusion can be installed on a new weapon and assigned a new owner for the installation cost, and a fusion seal can be used normally.";ar-fusion-secured;
AR;50;ar-seismic-pick;Weapon;Seismic Pick;;Equal parts tool and weapon, a seismic pick is used in Ulrikka Clanholdings’ mining efforts due to the added impact of its sonic emitters. These vibrations facilitate efficient excavation, and the picks prove similarly effective against armored opponents. Light and heavy seismic picks are equally useful in fighting or mining. Driver and demolition models are really weapons of war far more powerful than needed to perform most mining work.;ar-seismic-pick;
AR;65;ar-fusion-selective;WeaponFusion;SELECTIVE;;With the selective weapon fusion, you can exclude a single target from a weapon’s area of effect. When using a selective weapon to make an automatic, blast, explode, line, or other form of area attack that affects multiple targets, you can choose a single target to leave out of the area of effect.;ar-fusion-selective;
AR;41;ar-serpent-laser;Weapon;Serpent Laser;;The serpent laser is a creation of the Aspis Consortium, meant to undercut the pricing of its competitors while consuming battery charges at a higher rate to drive the sale of additional batteries, higher-capacity batteries, and recharging services. Experienced spacefarers know the scheme behind the serpent laser and generally avoid what they have come to call the “snakebite laser,” though amateurs and novices often fall for the low initial price. Serpent lasers have the same model names as many standard laser rifles (azimuth, corona, aphelion, and perihelion), though savvy customers know that the serpent laser models are often slightly less powerful than their conventional counterparts.;ar-serpent-laser;
AR;35;ar-shadow-chains;Weapon;Shadow Chains;;Worshipers of Zon-Kuthon developed the first shadow chains using cutting-edge heat-transfer technology, but outsiders rapidly reverse-engineered the weapons, constructing functional facsimiles from their own tech. Shadow chains’ links rapidly absorb heat, while their heavily insulated handle protect their wielders from direct exposure to the freezing darkness. Many adherents of the Midnight Lord make use of the follower, acolyte, and penitent shadow chains, while only the most devout can afford the more powerful ecclesiastic and devotional shadow chains.;ar-shadow-chains;
AR;35;ar-shadow-pistol;Weapon;Shadow Pistol;;Inspired by the Shadow Plane—or, some say, followers of Zon-Kuthon—a shadow pistol replicates the energy of the Plane of Shadow to momentarily separate the target from the thermodynamic energy of the universe, damaging it with the instantaneous change in temperature. With their shadowy appearance, the caliginous and sable models resemble guns cut from polished obsidian, while the more advanced tenebrous and umbral models look more like they were cut from the blackness of space.;ar-shadow-pistol;
AR;53;ar-shell-knuckles;Weapon;Shell Knuckles;;This bulky glove fits over the user’s hand, with reinforced plates covering the knuckles. When the weapon connects with a target, the kinetic force fires scattergun shells into the target and deal impressive bludgeoning damage. Mercenaries favor these weapons for fighting at close quarters, and pirates sometimes use them to make their punches all the more dramatic. Shell knuckles are available in tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models.;ar-shell-knuckles;
AR;39;ar-shellgun;Weapon;Shellgun;;A bulky weapon favored by scrappy fighters with limited resources, this oversized pistol uses scattergun shells as ammunition but creates a short-range tongue of flame. Thought to be inspired by the longer gulchgun, the shellgun is also a favorite of ysoki. Available models include the bombard shellgun, the blaze shellgun, and the fury shellgun.;ar-shellgun;
AR;53;ar-shield-projector;Weapon;Shield Projector;;A shield projector is a heavy weapon that encases its target in a short-duration force field, akin to that produced by an armor upgrade. Such force fields are of limited strength, but higher-power shield projectors can create a stronger protective barrier around the target. Shield projectors see the most use among security forces assigned to protect diplomats and high-profile celebrities. Available models—from the least to most powerful— include sentry, defender, guardian, and warden shield projectors.;ar-shield-projector;
AR;71;ar-shiftskin;Armor;Shiftskin;;"Developed by the reptoids for their agents, shiftskin comes in a variety of designs styled to resemble normal clothing, uniforms, and even other light armors. Each suit of shiftskin is designed to accommodate both its owner’s natural form and one other specific assumed form of another race, shifting and reshaping as needed when the reptoid changes shape. Thus a suit of shiftskin can be adjusted to accommodate two different forms (Core Rulebook 196), rather than fitting only one form at a time.
Shiftskin has been adapted for use by other races. Even when used by non-reptoids, an individual suit can still can be adapted to shift between two different forms, so long as those forms are no more than one size category apart. Though obviously of use for non-reptoid shapeshifters, this also allows the same suit to fit two different wearers.";ar-shiftskin;
AR;71;ar-shobhad-war-harness;Armor;Shobhad War Harness;;While a few shobhads still wear armor crafted from leather reinforced with metal plates, the shobhad-neh typically incorporate more advanced materials such as ballistic mesh and ceramic plates into the traditional designs of their ancestors. Despite having a high bulk for light armor, war harnesses are well padded and ventilated for comfort, as shobhads rarely remove their armor. Though some shobhad disdain the life support systems built into advanced armor, most recognize their value. The protective headgear, leggings, and sleeves used for such conditions stow discretely out of sight when not needed. The shobhad war harness comes in recruit, veteran, warleader, and chieftain varieties. The grades vary by quality of manufacture rather than appearance.;ar-shobhad-war-harness;
AR;48;ar-shock-pad;Weapon;Shock Pad;;A shock pad can be installed into an armor upgrade slot. When the user hits a target with the shock pad, the weapon emits an electric discharge that stuns or damages the target. These weapons are particularly valued in suits of powered armor that bring substantial strength to bear. Shock pads typically are available in static, aurora, storm, and tempest models.;ar-shock-pad;
AR;41;ar-shoulder-laser;Weapon;Shoulder Laser;;This laser weapon has a smooth, curved housing and an eyelike aperture, and it can be installed in an armor upgrade slot, leaving the wielder’s hands free for other tasks. As the name implies, most users mount the eyelike aperture over one shoulder, but it can work just as easily mounted on the torso or a forearm. Many shoulder laser users are androids who integrate them into their bodies as emergency weapons. Azimuth, corona, aphelion, and perihelion shoulder lasers are available in most areas.;ar-shoulder-laser;
AR;50;ar-shout-projector;Weapon;Shout Projector;;Shout projectors amplify your speech to overwhelming or destructive volume, and then project it in a cone. Words and sheer sonic pressure in this cone can’t be ignored. All shout projectors can be installed as armor upgrades (taking one upgrade slot per hand needed to wield the weapon), allowing the projectors to be used hands-free. That way, a user can carry lethal weaponry, safety gear, or protest signage. Exhorter shout projectors can be useful for crowd control with a lighter touch. Damper and pacifier models are ostensibly for nonlethal but more coercive applications, while the riot and crackdown projectors are for heavy-handed use.;ar-shout-projector;
AR;51;ar-shout-rifle;Weapon;Shout Rifle;;A shout rifle looks less like a rifle and much more like an elongated megaphone. It functions in much the same way, amplifying sound input, such as the wielder’s voice, to an extreme volume and projecting it outward in a wide area. Protest leaders use shout rifles, ensuring that their proclamations can be heard at a great distance. Law enforcement officials also appreciate these weapons for crowd control.;ar-shout-rifle;
AR;51;ar-shrieking-knife;Weapon;Shrieking Knife;;A shrieking knife remains silent until it strikes a target, only then emitting a shrill burst of lethal frequencies. Harmonic models use focused sound arrays that are similar in their output, while interference versions combine sounds to increased effects. Infrasonic and ultrasonic models are like the interference version, but they also use sound waves outside the normal hearing spectrum.;ar-shrieking-knife;
AR;51;ar-shrieking-larva;Weapon;Shrieking Larva;;Lashunta biologists genetically engineered the shrieking larva from a creature found in Castrovel’s jungles. This living weapon is dormant until fed power through a manual trigger. A telepathic user can mentally trigger the larva to siphon energy as needed, causing the weapon to fire faster than by trigger. When powered, the stimulated larva shrieks. This simultaneously shrill and oscillating outburst forms a coherent beam emitted in the direction the larva is pointed.;ar-shrieking-larva;
AR;51;ar-singing-disk;Weapon;Singing Disk;;A singing disk, also known as a shotalashu singer, is a 7-inch- diameter metal disk that is perforated with intricate abstract patterns and has a circular hole in the middle. When the weapon is swung or thrown, the perforations cause the air flowing through them to vibrate with a range of sonic frequencies like hundreds of voices singing simultaneously. The disks can sound quite lovely, but the sonic frequencies they create are unforgiving to the body and inner ear, and can muddle the mind. Singing disks have a series of models ranging from the sopranino to the soprano, alto, tenor, and bass versions.;ar-singing-disk;
AR;54;ar-singing-shuriken;Weapon;Singing Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. Designed by lashunta hunting specialists using the same acoustic principles as the singing disk, the singing shuriken generates a painful high-pitched whine when thrown and can befuddle a target with a piercing impact that disturbs the inner ear.;ar-singing-shuriken;
AR;51;ar-singing-spear;Weapon;Singing Spear;;As a singing spear moves through the air, grooves and channels along its length catch the wind, amplifying the noise into a strong sonic vibration. Lashunta shotalashu hunters of Castrovel originally used the weapons as the sound helped members of hunting parties keep track of one another and identify where targets might be in thick undergrowth. Singing spears sound pleasant, and can be found in sopranino, soprano, alto, and tenor models. Each has increasingly precise grooves for improved sonic damage that can disturb the inner ear and cause brief disorientation.;ar-singing-spear;
AR;54;ar-sledge;Weapon;Sledge;;Similar to the assault hammer (Core Rulebook 189), the sledge has an exceptionally dense weighted head and a strong haft. This unbalanced design makes the hammer more difficult to swing, but its strikes pack a punch.;ar-sledge;
AR;43;ar-solar-brand;Weapon;Solar Brand;;A solar brand consists of a flat plate that fits against the back of the hand, secured with a grip or a band. Once activated, the solar brand generates a protruding, arrowhead-shaped field of plasma. A red star solar brand doesn’t leave devastating marks, but the stronger yellow star, white star, and blue star models can cause lasting damage.;ar-solar-brand;
AR;51;ar-sonic-bolter;Weapon;Sonic Bolter;;The sound waves a sonic bolter produces tightly focus in a brief but coherent line. This concentrated, low-frequency vibration damages the body and jostles internal organs, causing dizziness, pain, and slight nausea. Members of the Android Abolitionist Front developed the light model upon discovering the effect of a similar beam. Heavy, assault, and devastator bolters can generate sufficient sound pressure to damage artificial and unliving creatures.;ar-sonic-bolter;
AR;51;ar-sonic-suppressor;Weapon;Sonic Suppressor;;A sonic suppressor noiselessly creates a static energy field that absorbs and amplifies sound, focusing the captured frequencies back upon the target in a damaging burst. Drow, assassins, and other covert killers favor the weapon because no sound escapes this bubble, resulting in a silent attack and, sometimes, a soundless takedown. The suppressor’s sonic cascade can have an anomalously large initial area, which crashes in from a wider radius, absorbing sound from and damaging those nearby while brutally affecting the intended target. Most manufacturers produce four suppressor models, including the murmur, whisper, hush, and repose.;ar-sonic-suppressor;
AR;65;ar-fusion-soulfire;WeaponFusion;SOULFIRE;;The soulfire fusion (and soulfire fusion seals) can only be applied to solarian weapon crystals. When you hit a target with a solar weapon augmented by a solarian weapon crystal with the soulfire fusion, you add your Charisma bonus to the damage done, in addition to your Strength bonus.;ar-fusion-soulfire;
AR;75;ar-spacer-carapace;PowArmor;Spacer Carapace;;"This powered armor resembles a bulky humanoid insect, including helmet-mounted oxygen canisters that appear as stylized mandibles. The armor’s wide boots contain powerful magnets useful for navigating the exterior of starships and space stations for repair work or guard duty. You can move your land speed across metal surfaces in zero gravity without having to attempt checks; if you are adjacent to a metal surface, you do not automatically move at the beginning of your turn each round. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers when you are standing on a metal surface.";ar-spacer-carapace;
AR;48;ar-spark-knife;Weapon;Spark Knife;;A spark knife is similar in appearance to a typical survival knife, leading to confusion among those unfamiliar with the weapon. In addition to dealing electricity damage, a spark knife can siphon electrical charge from its target’s natural electrical attacks, recharging its own battery. These blades were originally created in the Absalom Station neighborhood of Sparks, and different versions trace their names to their usage there: runner spark knives are relatively inexpensive, followed by recruit spark knives. Crew spark knives and boss spark knives are rarer, tracing back to those in established positions in the neighborhood’s social order.;ar-spark-knife;
AR;75;ar-spellcaster's-aegis-(hybrid);PowArmor;Spellcaster's Aegis (hybrid);;A reinforced frame with sunburst patterns that shift and spin, this armor projects holographic runes in the air around you as you move. If you have at least 5 ranks in Mysticism and the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, you can use these runes defensively, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities and a +2 enhancement bonus to dispel checks (such as when you cast dispel magic).;ar-spellcaster's-aegis-(hybrid);
AR;54;ar-spined-blade;Weapon;Spined Blade;;Kasathas on their home world wielded spined blades to better poison foes. Replicas of these ancient weapons can be found in the Museum of Ancestral Technology on the Idari. Modern warriors use refined versions of the weapon that are effective at delivering poisons and similar substances through contemporary armor. You apply such substances to the blade per rules found on page 232 of the Core Rulebook. While the basic version of the spined blade is generally analog, more advanced buzzblade, ripper, gravity, and rivener models are powered weapons.;ar-spined-blade;
AR;35;ar-spined-iceblade;Weapon;Spined Iceblade;;The spined iceblade is a variant of the traditional kasathan spined blade. Its longer, curved handle includes internal channels where coolant builds up until it is released by the wielder’s movements. Frostbite-class, hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, and avalanche- class spined iceblades are all readily available in markets that regularly serve kasathas, but similar weapons appearing on distant worlds have intrigued kasathan archaeologists.;ar-spined-iceblade;
AR;65;ar-fusion-stabilizing;WeaponFusion;STABILIZING;;The stabilizing fusion helps you keep your orientation in zero gravity. While wielding such a weapon, you can steady yourself even if you don’t have a surface to grab onto or a means of propulsion. If you do have such means, you can steady yourself as either a move action or a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus to checks to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. Only melee weapons, small arms, and long arms can benefit from the stabilizing fusion.;ar-fusion-stabilizing;
AR;51;ar-staccato-rifle;Weapon;Staccato Rifle;;A baffled tube on the underside of a staccato rifle produces and modulates discrete blasts of sonic frequencies. The rifle’s unique construction enables a fully automatic mode, producing a sound like drumming. The frequencies can leave a target’s auditory senses overwhelmed. Pulse staccato rifles have the shortest sonic projector for reliable repetitive shots with less power usage. Surge, drum, and hammer staccato rifles require more charge for a harder hit.;ar-staccato-rifle;
AR;75;ar-stag-step-suit-(hybrid);PowArmor;Stag-Step Suit (hybrid);;Forged and constructed from supernatural metals collected from the realms of the fey, this powered armor has long antlers atop its blank-faced helmet. If the armor has at least 10 charges remaining, you can spend 10 charges to create a fold in reality, per the dimension door spell. You can travel only 100 feet with this ability, and you can’t take other creatures with you. Once you have used this ability, the stag-step suit retains a charge of dimensional static that prevents you from using the armor’s ability again for 24 hours.;ar-stag-step-suit-(hybrid);
AR;75;ar-starguard;PowArmor;Starguard;;This shimmering golden armor is made primarily of reinforced esaris, a extremely light and durable proprietary material developed by the kasathan doyenate. One of the most expensive and well-designed armors produced by kasathans, starguard deflects energy attacks nearly as effectively as its reinforced frame absorbs physical blows. The interior of the helmet provides continuous status updates about your surroundings, providing you blindsight (vibration) with a range of 120 feet.;ar-starguard;
AR;54;ar-sting-pistol;Weapon;Sting Pistol;;Sting pistols are living weapons based on samples of Swarm technology recovered during the last century. The chitinous weapon converts power to internally generate and shoot acid- slicked needles that can cause lasting damage to the target. Ant models are sturdy and commonplace, though yellow jacket and wasp sting pistols are more powerful. Hornet models are the heaviest and most potent of these weapons.;ar-sting-pistol;
AR;48;ar-storm-coil;Weapon;Storm Coil;;A storm coil employs an air-core resonant transformer to produce high-voltage electrical output. The resulting bolt of electricity arcs out from the weapon in a line. Though it employs technology similar to the colossus coil, the storm coil was developed independently within the Pact Worlds. Live storm coils and jolt storm coils generate impressive bolts, while the larger impulse and surge storm coils have even farther reach.;ar-storm-coil;
AR;48;ar-storm-hammer;Weapon;Storm Hammer;;"This massive warhammer’s magnetic discharge deals additional damage that can sometimes knock a target to the ground. Dwarves in the Diasporan Star Citadels first developed storm hammers to bring larger foes to a more manageable height; many bear aesthetic designs hearkening to Angradd and other dwarven motifs. The materials used in a storm hammer’s construction determine the magnetic force and thereby the strength of the weapon; available versions include diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and metamagnetic storm hammers.";ar-storm-hammer;
AR;48;ar-stormcaller;Weapon;Stormcaller;;Some barathu researchers who intensively study the titanic lightning storms found on their home world become obsessed with the phenomenon. The efforts of such scientists led to the creation of the stormcaller, a living weapon that generates a line of electricity originating not from the wielder but from a single point within the weapon’s relatively short range. Like most barathu creations, stormcallers are living creatures, and their massive shells are large enough to require two hands to wield, aided by the stormcaller wrapping its translucent tentacles around the user’s appendages. Sheet and ribbon stormcallers are powerful weapons in their own right, while rocket and smooth-channel stormcallers can summon electrical currents that live up to the weapons’ namesake.;ar-stormcaller;
AR;48;ar-stun-staff;Weapon;Stun Staff;;Stewards often make use of the combined offensive and defensive flexibility of a stun staff, a polycarbonate staff with an electrode- lined striking surface. These weapons are commonly used in riot control due to their ability to easily inflict nonlethal damage, but they’re also valuable in self-defense, and their streamlined appearance means they don’t attract overmuch attention at formal events where security is as necessary as discretion. As a cousin of the shock truncheon, the stun staff bears a similar naming convention, with the tactical stun staff as the most basic, followed by the static, aurora, storm, and tempest models.;ar-stun-staff;
AR;35;ar-subduer;Weapon;Subduer;;A subduer resembles a hollow rod with internal coolant reserves, and it relies on the user’s forceful movements to spray the coolant forward. Employed primarily by kasathan security forces to prevent suspects from fleeing, subduers coat their targets in a thin layer of expelled coolants that cause temporary painful freezing of the target’s skin that deals little lasting damage. On a lucky shot, the frozen layer also interferes with the target’s ability to function. Frost and rime subduers are often employed by peacekeeping forces, while sleet and glacier subduers typically see use only by pirates or mercenary groups.;ar-subduer;
AR;48;ar-surgecaster;Weapon;Surgecaster;;"Surgecasters are bioengineered organic weapons; these independent conglomerations of bioelectric cells generate deadly bursts of electricity when fired. They were invented by a flotilla of merged barathus that directed its efforts toward creating such a weapon, and its success has resulted in the continued production of the surgecaster as a viable commercial endeavor. Only two models are currently available on the market: a standard surgecaster and an advanced surgecaster, though the merged barathu entity appears to be continuing its research and development efforts.";ar-surgecaster;
AR;75;ar-surnoch-suit;PowArmor;Surnoch Suit;;"This sturdy gray suit of powered armor has rows of fine blades running along the body and limbs, which serve as digging claws; it is often used by elite sapper teams to reach entrenched enemies. A surnoch suit grants you a burrow speed. You can tunnel through rock while wearing a surnoch suit, but your speed is reduced to 5 feet.";ar-surnoch-suit;
AR;54;ar-switchblade;Weapon;Switchblade;;This blade looks much like a single-edged survival knife when opened, but the blade can be folded or collapsed to fit within the grip, making it easier to conceal. A switch on the knife means the blade can be folded or extended as a swift action, or as part of making an attack or full attack. Most weapon manufacturers that offer daggers also produce switchblades, which are made in the same models: tactical, ultrathin, zero-edge, and molecular rift.;ar-switchblade;
AR;54;ar-tailblade;Weapon;Tailblade;;Developed by ysoki on Akiton, this slender, lightweight blade has a series of bands that attach the blade to a tail or similar anatomy. Although using a tailblade doesn’t allow you to make additional attacks, it can free up your hands without leaving you unarmed.;ar-tailblade;
AR;54;ar-talon;Weapon;Talon;;A talon is a stylized weapon with a fitted grip and a curved, serrated blade. It can be used as a slashing weapon without activating the battery. When powered, the talon converts energy into acid that can melt through certain types of armor (though the weapon always targets a foe’s KAC). Shirrens favor talons, and some consider them to be holy weapons of Hylax, referring to them as the queen’s talons. Increasingly advanced models of the weapon are often named after roles of some hive- dwelling species, beginning with drone, and advancing through warrior, knight, queen, and god.;ar-talon;
AR;54;ar-tetrad-rings;Weapon;Tetrad Rings;;Tetrad rings deal lighter damage than weapons of a similar class, but the device launches a bolt of force that bypasses many common defenses. The design of tetrad rings is proprietary witchwyrd technology, which makes them expensive and difficult to find. They are manufactured in only three models: tactical, advanced, and elite. All three are elaborate sets of rings covered in delicate carvings, with a wire mesh to house the battery. Advanced and elite models have finer decorations.;ar-tetrad-rings;
AR;65;ar-fusion-throwing;WeaponFusion;THROWING;;The throwing fusion makes even the most cumbersome melee weapon usable as a thrown weapon. A melee weapon with this fusion gains the thrown special property with a range increment of 10 feet. If the weapon has an item level of 10 or higher, the range increment is 20 feet. This fusion allows you to add additional fusions that benefit thrown weapons. You must be proficient with a melee weapon with the throwing fusion in order to benefit from the thrown special property granted by it. Only melee weapons can benefit from the throwing fusion.;ar-fusion-throwing;
AR;49;ar-t-quark-crystal;Weapon;T-Quark Crystal;;T-quark crystals have a rapid rate of decay that a solarian can manipulate a limited number of times per day to charge his solar weapon for a more powerful strike. When the t-quark crystal is active, the solar weapon is surrounded by a chaotic storm of particles, the spiraling results of the crystal’s decay. T-quark crystals are available in least, minor, lesser, standard, greater, and true varieties.;ar-t-quark-crystal;
AR;65;ar-fusion-tracking;WeaponFusion;TRACKING;;"The tracking fusion lets you locate a creature recently damaged by the weapon. Activating the fusion is a move action that binds the tracking fusion to the first creature you damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn. Once you track a target with this fusion, you are aware of the target’s location as long as it is within 1,000 feet and you keep the weapon with this fusion in hand.
If the target is further away, you can attempt a Perception check (opposed by the target creature’s Stealth check) to know approximately what direction the creature is in, though not accurately enough to triangulate its exact location. This is considered a magic divination. The tracking effect is removed if the target travels more than 10 miles away from you, the target changes planes, the effect is dispelled, you fail a Perception check to know its general distance by 10 or more, or 24 hours have passed since you last damaged the target with this weapon. For the purposes of dispelling the tracking effect, treat the effect as a spell with a caster level equal to the weapon’s item level. You can track only one creature at a time. Activating the tracking weapon fusion again automatically ends any previous binding. Only attacks made by the weapon against a single target can benefit from this fusion.
";ar-fusion-tracking;
AR;54;ar-ultraserrated-shuriken;Weapon;Ultraserrated Shuriken;;Shuriken are bladed thrown weapons most common in the carbonedge form kasathas favor. However, these weapons are versatile and come in various forms for improved cutting power or specialized use. Additionally, the size of shuriken makes them easy to hide and carry. They are ideal for hit-and-run attacks and situations where it might not be prudent to retrieve a thrown weapon. Small but deadly, an ultraserrated shuriken has molecular-level serrations that enhance slashing.;ar-ultraserrated-shuriken;
AR;65;ar-fusion-vanishing;WeaponFusion;VANISHING;;The vanishing fusion can hide its wielder from the sight of one foe. Once per day after making an attack with your weapon, regardless of whether you hit your target, you can become invisible to that target per invisibility for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s item level. Any attacks you make (even against other targets) end your invisibility as normal. All creatures other than the target continue to be able to see you normally. Only small arms and weapons with the operative special property can benefit from this fusion.;ar-fusion-vanishing;
AR;71;ar-vesk-brigandine;Armor;Vesk Brigandine;;The core of vesk brigandine is a lightweight breastplate made of interlocking polymer hexagons. It flexes almost as well as fabric under normal use, but it becomes rigid as steel in response to impact. Its slim profile lets it be worn either over or under clothing. More advanced brigandine designs incorporate inertial dampeners to enhance protection. Vesk who prize mobility over maximum protection favor this style of light armor, and its use has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to the degree that any similar design is often referred to as vesk brigandine.;ar-vesk-brigandine;
AR;51;ar-vibrogarrote;Weapon;Vibrogarrote;;The vibrogarrote is similar to an analog garrote, but the handle contains a battery pack to power the weapon, and the garrote wire produces a coherent, cutting sound. When used, the vibrogarrote makes a distinctive pitch based on how long the wire has been extended. Basic, harmonic, and interference vibrogarrotes produce only audible frequencies, while infrasonic and ultrasonic vibrogarrotes also generate waves outside the typical auditory spectrum for additional damage.;ar-vibrogarrote;
AR;36;ar-void-rifle;Weapon;Void Rifle;;A firearm designed with crystals from the Plane of Shadow, a void rifle is unique in that power flowing through those crystals allows the rifle to fire inky bolts of life-sapping cold. The rifle’s frigid energy can harm only the living, so it does nothing to constructs and undead. Regardless, the rifle remains a favorite of followers of Urgathoa. Grave- and crypt-class void rifles are an option for standard issue among rank-and-file marines of the Eoxian navy, while tomb-, ossuary-, and barrow-class void rifles are reserved for elite forces.;ar-void-rifle;
AR;36;ar-void-staff;Weapon;Void Staff;;Quite common on Eox, void staves are designed using extensive necromancy-derived technologies, resulting in nonreflective black coloration and a range of morbid effects. A target struck by a void staff suffers effects similar to frostbite, as the weapon drains the life energy out of the target on a cellular level and, in some cases, causes complications with breathing and other essential functions. Grave-class, crypt-class, tomb-class, and ossuary-class void staves are relatively common throughout the Pact Worlds, while barrow-class void staves are almost never seen anywhere except Eox.;ar-void-staff;
AR;51;ar-wailing-blade;Weapon;Wailing Blade;;While it looks like a longsword at a glance, a wailing blade is composed of a series of microtextured plates. When powered, these plates vibrate to generate an array of sonic frequencies at deafening and damaging volumes. A tymbal wailing blade produces only a single audible sound, while a euphonic wailing blade produces multiple pitches concurrently. Strident wailing blades and warbler wailing blades have pitches that vary, the former sounding like a layered chirping and the latter combining trilling notes.;ar-wailing-blade;
AR;54;ar-warclub;Weapon;Warclub;;Though technologically as simple as a one-handed club, the two-handed warclub is larger, heavier, and more dangerous. They are popular among enforcers and thugs.;ar-warclub;
AR;54;ar-warfan;Weapon;Warfan;;A warfan is a semicircle of nanocarbon fabric with a series of carbonedge ribs spaced evenly in a radial pattern. The ends of these ribs are sharpened such that a proficient wielder can block incoming attacks and make melee strikes with the weapon held in one hand. The flashy movements involved in using a warfan make it a superb weapon for combat when appearances matter as much as damage dealt.;ar-warfan;
AR;75;ar-warmaster's-harness;PowArmor;Warmaster's Harness;;The most sophisticated and powerful version of the common powered battle harness, the warmaster’s harness resembles a towering, armored titan. Its wide shoulder frame normally mounts short-range communication equipment to orchestrate troop movements or an enormous banner to identify military affiliation. It is often used by the generals of entire armies (or by assistants to such generals, in cases where the general cannot be risked directly on the front lines).;ar-warmaster's-harness;
AR;39;ar-wave-modulator;Weapon;Wave Modulator;;The frequency of a wave modulator’s output can be adjusted to either burn a target or bombard it with damaging sonic bursts. Shirrens favor these boxy pistols because of the thrill of choosing the damage type of every shot fired. Wave modulators come in numbered models.;ar-wave-modulator;
AR;49;ar-w-boson-crystal;Weapon;W-Boson Crystal;;A w-boson crystal amplifies the sheer amount of damage a weapon deals. The shard w-boson crystal is presented here, while other models can be found in the Core Rulebook.;ar-w-boson-crystal;
AR;40;ar-web-grenade;BattleWare;Web Grenade;;Developed using samples of haans’ biological webbing, a web grenade explodes to cover the area in sticky strands of high- tensile fibers, making the affected area difficult terrain.;ar-web-grenade;
AR;43;ar-welder;Weapon;Welder;;Though generally recognized as tools, welders are so commonly used as improvised weapons that some ysoki manufacturers have begun designing them to serve equally well in both roles. A welder is often little more than a battery casing and an exposed plasma conduit. Utility welders are simple and straightforward, and industrial welders are more powerful and built to be more comfortable for more regular use. Starship welders are versatile and relatively compact for their output, while offensive welders are intended for combat first and maintenance only as an afterthought.;ar-welder;
AR;75;ar-winter-walker;PowArmor;Winter Walker;;The thick legs of this heavily insulated armor end in short retractable spikes, allowing you to easily anchor yourself to most surfaces. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC when resisting bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers as long as you are standing on the ground. You and the armor are immune to cold damage and cold environments, even when your environmental protections are not active. Your movement is not slowed by icy surfaces, and the DCs of Acrobatics checks you attempt on such surfaces do not increase.;ar-winter-walker;
AR;55;ar-wraith-sting-rifle;Weapon;Wraith-Sting Rifle;;Wraith-sting rifles fire darts that are loaded with an injectable substance. The low velocity and slim profile of these darts mean the target often remains unaware of the initial attack. Once the effects of the injected substance take hold, however, it is usually easy to identify the delivery method. These insidious weapons are said to be a favorite of reptoid assassins, but as with any information on that race, the veracity of this rumor is suspect. Ironically, this weapon’s models are named after stinging insects: yellow jacket, wasp, and hornet.;ar-wraith-sting-rifle;
AR;49;ar-z-boson-crystal;Weapon;Z-Boson Crystal;;This specialized weapon crystal causes a solar weapon to twist energy, momentum, and even stranger forces around it. A weapon enhanced with a z-boson crystal deals increased damage and can sometimes give a target unexpected momentum, hurling it backward. Z-boson crystals are fairly esoteric and can be found in shard, least, minor, lesser, standard, greater, and true versions.;ar-z-boson-crystal;
AR;36;ar-zero-knife;Weapon;Zero Knife;;"A zero knife appears much like a folded switchblade, though the hilt is somewhat bulkier due to the battery; when activated, the zero knife forms a blade formed entirely of an aura of intense cold rather than steel. The frostbite-class zero knife is an easily obtained weapon whose blade rapidly accumulates flakes of frozen material in most atmospheres. The more advanced hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, avalanche- class, and icequake-class zero knives incorporate technology that eliminates the build-up.";ar-zero-knife;
CR;205;cr-armor-upgrade-automated-loader;ArmorUpgrade;Automated loader;;"This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a move action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Abilities that let you reload faster than a move action don’t apply to an automated loader.
This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.";cr-armor-upgrade-automated-loader;
CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-backup-generator;ArmorUpgrade;Backup generator;;You can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn’t produce charges when you’re resting or otherwise stationary.;cr-armor-upgrade-backup-generator;
CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-deflective-reinforcement;ArmorUpgrade;Deflective reinforcement;;This upgrade gives your armor a uniquely slippery texture. Your armor grants you DR 5/—. In addition, your armor check penalty is reduced by 2 when you attempt an Acrobatics check to escape.;cr-armor-upgrade-deflective-reinforcement;
CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-electrostatic-field;ArmorUpgrade;Electrostatic field;;"This field over your armor grants you electricity resistance, and any creature that touches you or deals damage to you with a melee weapon takes electricity damage. The resistance granted and damage dealt depend on this upgrade’s type, as noted below.

<li>Mk 1: Resistance 5 and 1d6 electricity damage.</li>
<li>Mk 2: Resistance 10 and 2d6 electricity damage.</li>
<li>Mk 3: Resistance 15 and 3d6 electricity damage.</li>

CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-exit-pod;ArmorUpgrade;Exit pod;;"This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor as a move action instead of as a full action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod.
This can be installed only in heavy armor or powered armor.";cr-armor-upgrade-exit-pod;
CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-filtered-rebreather;ArmorUpgrade;Filtered rebreather;;This upgraded rebreather supplements your armor’s ability to provide fresh air and filters out common toxins and poisonous vapors. Armor with this upgrade can provide fresh air for a number of weeks equal to its level. You also gain acid resistance 5 and a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison and disease.;cr-armor-upgrade-filtered-rebreather;
CR;206;cr-armor-upgrade-force-field;ArmorUpgrade;Force field;;"You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.
While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field’s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round. More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.

AR;82;ar-armor-upgrade-computer-interface;ArmorUpgrade;Computer interface;;"Your armor is wired to allow an integrated onboard computer to monitor your condition and operate some functions of your armor. An armor interface comes with a tier 1 computer with an artificial personality and a single control module linked to your armor. You can access this computer without exposing it or yourself to the environment outside of your armor, and you receive information from it through heads-up displays and broadcasts via your armor’s integrated comm unit.
With a successful Computers check (DC = the DC needed to hack the computer) you can set the computer to give basic information about your condition (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and so on) to authorized users (which you designate), or to anyone with a medkit, advanced medkit, or medical lab. Characters who can access this information gain a
+2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks they attempt on you. With 10 minutes of work, you can set the computer’s control module to operate any one system in your armor, as long as that system doesn’t take a full action or longer to activate or deactivate. Common applications are environmental protections or a force field armor upgrade. You can set the computer to operate the upgrade at your command (allowing you to activate one such item each round without taking an action to do so), or set it to automatically trigger the system under specific conditions as follows: the first time you take damage, the first time you take Hit Point damage, when you are stunned, when you are staggered, when you are unconscious, or when the atmospheric conditions change. If the trigger occurs, the computer automatically activates the linked system. This occurs at the end of your next turn after the condition occurs. The control module can be linked to weapons or tools that are part of the armor, subject to the normal limitations of control modules (Core Rulebook 215).
You can install a higher-tier computer into the computer interface, as long as it has light or negligible bulk. You must pay for the additional computer separately, and installing it requires a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the DC to hack the new computer. The computer cannot have countermeasures that require links to the environment beyond the armor (such as a shock grid) or control modules that control anything other than armor systems, and it cannot activate more than one system each round (even if linked to multiple systems with automatic triggers).
